It's yet another place for coffee snobs than for a nice casual and affordable breakfast or brunch.

I'll take simple and affordable any day over high-end looks and coffee. Like Italian food, breakfast does not need to be expensive. Any diner in the US does it better, cheaper, friendlier, faster, and with more options, than anywhere I've seen in Singapore. 

They do have good service and good quality eggs.  The saltiness and olive oil on the eggs killed the taste for me, to where I struggled to eat them; our waitress dismissed my dissatisfaction as they being ""healthy"" that way. A Big No for future patronage.

French toast was a bit small for $18.

Warning: For those who don't like added oil on your eggs, be sure to specify without; 

I see it like pepper - don't put it on people's food unless you ask them first, mention it on the menu, and better yet, rather than serve it with, have it on the table for the customer to do for themselves. 

I originally gave it a high three stars for the overall quality of ingredients and atmosphere, but revised it to two (because there is no 2.5 option) as in reality, we have not been back since this visit months ago in favour of other places, and are not likely to return except out of boredom of our regular brunch places."

I mean really good coffee is actually harder to find in Singapore than you would think given the plethora of coffee shops opening here. Chye Seng Huat's blend is not only good on most days, it can be one of the best in Singapore. We have been tag teaming this establishment and Toby's Estate over in Robertson Quay for sometime and we think Chye Seng Huat may be starting to edge out the Quay's competition including Kith.

Having said that, the reason why they lost out those extra points to score well in my books:

1. Their food is just A-OK. I think the best dish I've had in there is their steak sandwich. Cakes lift their game a little.

2. Floor service is really good for a coffee shop so the fact that they have so many service staff on the floor puzzled me as to why the staff can't take orders. You must go queue at the cashier and order there. Make sense? Not to me. They have a strength but are not entirely using it effectively.

3. Cashier service, as it has become a customer front and interface is actually not that good despite the good floor service. As Chye Seng Huat has pushed the customer experience to us queuing at the cashier, I have to say that the cashier has on a number of occasions not controlled the queue properly by allowing selfish customers who stand right in front of the cashier waiting for their takeaway coffee and hindering attempts from customers behind wanting to place their order so they can sit down again!

4. Chye Seng Huat opens at 9am (its stated very clearly). Yet, on one morning, management apparently decided to hold a staff meeting at 9am that didn't finish until 9:30am. Not only that, they decided not to offer customers standing outside waiting to come in to sit down.

So while the place definitely serves good coffee, we feel that management needs to pick up some common sense and optimise and improve quality of customer service and its hot food menu.

Has POTENTIAL but is not recognising and/or addressing the gaps. I feel their overall rating is a little inflated because I have read reviews here where they point out similar flaws I've found and still rate it as 4 stars?!!! C'mon people. Stop promoting poor service in Singapore please."

Anyhow, if you're in the Thomson area looking for a cheap and affordable meal, look no further than Meng's Kitchen! Plus, they are open for 24 hours so you can satisfy your BCM craving at anytime. There's always a crowd at Meng's, even before Udders came and made the area even more lively after 11pm.  

The noodles are springy, the portion of minced meat is generous and the chilli-vinegar combination is just right. The soup's good too. Other than the BCM, also try the fried fishcakes which are crispy and bouncy. A bowl of this makes a perfect post-drinks meal!"

We've been gluttons many a time, getting up from our spicy Thai meal, and strolling 3 steps across the corridor to Tom's for a scoop or two of creamy ice cream to put out the flames on our tongue. 

My favourite is the Horlicks paired with 'Granny's Favourite', which is a malty chocolate flavor. It tastes a lot milkier and creamier than the usual ice cream, to the point where it's almost the consistency of gelato - I like! Since they pride themselves in creating a new flavor each month, I love trying out some of their more 'innovative' ice creams, like Oolong Tea, Wasabi Lime and Red Wine Ice Cream. Although some of them are too extreme for me to have a full scoop, I still give 5 stars for creativity and persistence in their concept!"

1. The garden theme 

The Interior decor gets a 4.5 stars: The garden-themed cafe is beautifully decorated with lots of plants & flowers, making it a little sanctuary with all the cute ornaments and knick knacks you can find all around the cafe. 

It is really perfect for couples or friends to have cosy get-togethers here. Unlike other cafes, the space is big! 2 storeys all in all, and the space between each table is of a good distance! No fear of people eavesdropping on your conversation, unless of course, you speak really loudly :p

2. Florist 

This place is owned by <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FXpressflower.com&s=e0b2624a6af8303359d87f8094b05e286d1b3eda7b2a73835104bf5f0b448071"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Xpressflower.com</a>, a long established florist chain with 16 outlets in SG (I found that out from their website). 

There is a cold room with lotsa flowers inside. 
It's quite fun to peek through the glass window and see what flowers they have for that day. 

Very handy if you intend to just pick up some flowers to decorate your home or get a bouquet for that special someone after a meal here. 

3. Furniture store 

Knots is also a furniture store! Everything you see, even the chair u sit on is for sale. Who knows? I may just decide to buy one one of these days. I was really quite taken with the round wooden table and chairs we sat on during yesterday's dinner. Let me think about it lol #wink

4. Food

Unfortunately, this cafe really needs to do much better when it comes to their food. Last night was my 3rd visit and I must say I was pleasantly surprised that the dinner we had was much much better than the ones I had with my friends in the first two visits.

5. Reasonable price (value for money)

Fortunately, the prices at Knots are really reasonable. Our dinner last night set us back around $35 for our 2 mains. That's really ok by SG standards where foods in many similar cafes can be quite expensive. 

So, for all the reasons above, I will keep coming back to Knots Cafe in the years to come. If only they improve on their food quality, I will happily write a new review and change my rating to 5 stars.

Around 15 mins. Waiting for the food was abit slower. Service was kinda average. They had service bell on the table but they were kinda useless. It is much faster raising your hands and getting service. 

The service staff serving our table had limited knowledge of English so asking her questions like 'do you sell the coffee beans' needed another staff to help. 

Food wise it was a hit and miss. I had the demi-glacé omu rice. The sauce was decent but the proportion of the rice to the sauce was inbalanced. I think they should give more sauce or reduce the size of the dish. 

The dessert was a letdown. I had the creme brûlée. The dessert was not made on the spot since the crust sugar was cold on taste. 

Price wise I find it a tad expensive."

We got back to the hotel around 8pm and I ventured out after I freshened up a bit. I was hungry so I scoped what is around and landed here. 

A lady approached me and lured me into ordering from her food stand. I was actually looking to order my first bowl of soup but the curry rice won me over. For under $5 SGD, I got a plate packed full of carbohydrates, proteins, and fat. Though the curry was a bit watery but it had some heat and was quite delicious. The fried pork chop was tough as a rock but the over-easy egg took this dish to another level. I love eggs on everything! The fried chicken was juicy. The lady asked if I wanted fish, I thanked her but declined but she still threw some in... =/ I did not eat it because it looked slimy. It was steamed. 

I enjoyed it. Her smile and talkative nature was definitely unique compared to the other folks working behind the counter. Nothing more comforting than a plate of curry rice. Oh my... I wish I was back in Singapore."

The cashier lady was an older obasan who was extremely patient and kind with us as we scoured the display window for a avoid-the-sun snack. We decided on dan ta's each, their powdered bread...which I totally forgot the name! The baked goods weren't spectacular, but that's because we're spoiled with delicious California baked goods and cheap/fresh Taiwanese bakery bread when we travel.

Their dan ta has a crunchier and thinner (not flaky) crust and sweeter egg in the center. It was pretty good, just made differently and just as fresh. Their powdered bread was not the business. We felt like it was just bread with powdered sugar on top...nothing special. Looking around, we saw that they also offered other baked sweets as well as more ""kitchen-made"" orders like soups and porridges. 

It's great to get a dan ta if you're in the Ann Siang Hill/Chinatown area, but it's not some place I would say is a ""distinguishing"" part of Singaporean local eats."

The first time I was in a Dal.Komm, it was at the location at Centrepoint (or was it Centerpoint (Sp?)) mall. I had a rose latte and a mille crepe. They were good.

During my quarantine (Stay-Home Notice) in Singapore this past June, I was housed at the Conrad Centennial Singapore. I had all my meals provided in the hotel but knowing me, I needed my sweet treats and a change of food.  With the late night binge watching Doom at Your Service, I definitely needed something to sustain myself throughout the night.

I ordered from this particular location multiple times throughout my quarantine, via this Foodpanda delivery app for their Rose Latte, Mango Cube and Coffee Cube. They were so yummy! One could not really find something similar anywhere else. At times I would order a few so I could have one for the day and one for the night. Yep, I could be that extra :P 

Then one night I decided to get some snack and saw this Ssamjang Chicken Cruffin on their online menu. There was no going back ever since. That Ssamjang Chicken was absolutely amazing! I never have anything like that. The cruffin was super flakey and the Ssamjang chicken so tasty. Words really could not describe it. One just needed to try and would get to know what I meant. 

The staffs clearly cared and always packed the food and drink items extremely well. I had never physically go to that location before but managed to visit the store before I flew back to Atlanta. The staffs there were super nice and the ambience was definitely an A+

There was no Yoo Shi-Jin or Seo Dae-young at the café, it was still a cool place to be at. I was happy to be there :D

Many thanks to the staffs at this Dal.komm location, your staffs made my quarantine even better :)"

It is not clearly visible from outside but be sure to look for PS Cafe sign.  I think best choice would be to use google map.  I got lost and I got a help from Google Map.   Entrance is like walking into someone's garden..  After 50 ft of walk into forest/garden path, you will see beautiful restaurant/café.

I noticed most of the customer's were foreigners or tourist..  I don't think local people comes here since everything is little pricey.

I love the interior design..  So beautiful.  Very modern looking with classical touches throughout the restaurant.  I wanted to seat outside at the patio but weather was just too hot..  Inside is fully air conditioned.

I visited this location around 3 PM.  It was too early for dinner so I had Lychee drink and cake for dessert...  Chocolate cake was so good.. But taste of coffee was so so..."

What I Love: It's at a great location, very accessible. The service is great, and their Coconuts are really fresh and affordable - I think, $3? Which is really pretty okay. I've paid $5 in Changi Village - which is definitely kinda pricey. Their other drinks, Water Chestnut, Bandung, and canned options are also pretty affordable and tasty. Gotta try their Desserts - they are really, really, really yummy!! I usually ask them to make my Ice Kacang with just the Gula Melaka (Omg - I feel like having it RIGHT NOW!) and their Soursop, and other cold concoctions are all pretty good.

I've been to this branch a couple of times and the staff have always been very nice and the drink have never disappointed. Thanks! :) 

Classic original Thai milk tea, Thai milk tea extra gold are the two norms for me. Also the Thai green tea I've tried and was okay and is more like Jasmine green and was good too but I prefer the classic Thai and Thai extra gold. 

I believe the extra gold has a much stronger tea taste. 

You can order drinks hot or cold or even some blended.

They also sell coffee, matcha, and honey milk. This branch also has Shibuya thick toast and simple sandwich sets. 

Overall ambiance, pretty chill and nice staff. Order on one side and collect on the other part of the counter. Many office workers come from in from around this area too. Generally a good place I can count on for a good cup of tea. 

Tip/ you can ask for more/less ice 
Tip2/ it's inside the Far East Square mall

One of the earliest tenants of the area, Brownice, is located further inwards, within Sin Ming Centre, which specializes in ice cream made from all natural, egg-free and non-dairy products.

Satisfying my waffle cravings, I ordered the Waffles with Peanut Butter Chocolate ($7.30; $3.80 for waffles, $3.50 for 1 scoop). The waffles is crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The Peanut Butter Chocolate accompanying it, while trying to strike a balance between both flavours, tasted more chocolatey than the peanut butter taste.

Anyone can enjoy the ice cream here without feeling guilty due to the nature of the contents. If you are around the Sin Ming / Upper Thomson area, this is one spot that should not be missed."

1. Nice ambience and good for chillaxing in any weather :)

2. Crispy waffles that come in 3 flavours : choc, cookiebutter and original. If u must try only one- go for the choc lol...but I am a choc lover so... :)

3. Good variety of flavours which are split into two categories: premium and usual ones. 

Now...The not so great :
1. Pricey. I ordered 2 flavours - one premium one usual - with the triple waffles ( small pieces )which came up to $18. 

2. Staff was ok and doing what he needed to do but.... made me not want to ask him for more flavours trials lol... U know what I mean.... If he had been a bit more accommodating, I would have ordered more premium flavours actually... Also when I asked if the original flavoured waffle came with syrup, he just stated that it is on the waffle...and there was just one other customer who was done paying up so he wasn't busy till he could not have just offered more syrup or a smile. Lol! I think good service makes customers come back for more since there are so many ice cream shops we can choose to go otherwise."

I also really admire the fact I could drink coffee, look up and there you are, a TOILET BOWL complete with toilet paper right above my head. It's so randomly ridiculous yet genius that I LURVE IT. I even took a picture of it, go see.

I ordered the banana bread pudding, - $14, and coffee. The presentation of the bread pudding was very cute, it came in a pot, on a wooden slab. Coffee was better than most cafes I've been to, and service was... Let's just say that they let you do your own thing, and they do theirs, and if both lines should intersect, colourful unicorns will bloom. Pricing is on the high side.

One thing that made me feel like getting up to leave, was the glaring red neon lighting fixture, that engulfed me and my companion. It reminded me of an episode in Seinfeld (who else still watches this?!) where Kramer's entire room emitted a red glow because Kenny Rogers moved opposite his room and their crazy signboard faced his window.

Slipper lobster, pan-fried barramundi, coconut curry, fried wonton strips, quail eggs, fish cake, beancurd puffs
Quite rich and creamy while not too spicy although would prefer it in thick bee hoon. Lovely texture by the crispy wonton skin.

PASTA
Crab Pomodoro (S$24++)
Spaghetti, jumbo lump crabmeat, shaved parmigiana, spicy pomodoro sauce with a touch of cream
Lots of chunky crabmeat although got to beware of the bird's eye chilli. Think  it's the most spicy of all the dishes we have tonite.

Truffle Carbonara (S$24++)
Fettuccine, shiitake & white button mushrooms, porcini cream sauce, poached egg, shaved parmigiana, truffle paste
The crowd favourite although sadly the slightly too firm yolk didn't flow as expected.

BURGER 
Bom Chika Wow Wow (S$20++)
Fried chicken, fried egg, vintage cheddar, pear slaw, pickled daikon, truffle mayo 

DESSERT 
Apple Crumble (S$12++)
New Zealand vanilla bean ice cream 

Sticky Ondeh Pudding (S$13++)
Pandan sticky pudding, gula melaka coconut filling, New Zealand vanilla bean ice cream
Interesting to find filling inside the pudding. Even with the sauce, it was not too sweet. The combination of the slightly hot pudding and cold ice cream was great. Plus crumbles for additional texture.

BEVERAGE 
Coconut Dalgona (S$8++)
Most only heard of Dalgona which is made of frothy coffee on top of milk. The version here got coffee jelly in it plus bits of desiccated coconut."

The inside is quite small and cosy, but the limited space is put to good use. A communal table lies in the centre of the room, flanked by counter seats, and a door that leads to a shaded outdoor seating area. Tampers and espresso shot cups line the shelves, while the staff pull shots at an open bar counter lined with espresso machines and grinders. I like the concept - it's always interesting to see the baristas at work, and for coffee geeks, to see the shots themselves being pulled. This can tell you a lot about the quality of coffee at a cafe - a spaghetti strand sized column of dark black liquid slowly lining a shot cup is a sign of good underlying espresso, while a 10 second downpour of pale brown liquid is a hint that you should quietly slip out the entrance without waiting for your drink. Fortunately, La Ristretto's shots were good examples of the former, with a 20 second extraction of potent espresso.  

The espresso shot had a medium brown crema, and a robust, full bodied flavour with distinct hints of chocolate. It was bright without being bitter, and potent without being burnt. The shot glass of water on the side is a nice touch also, and was used, as the serving size is a little larger than usual for a single shot. The coffee beans used were from Agust coffee roasters in Italy, which I haven't come across in Asia before, and are quite distinct in their own right. It's also interesting to be able to sample a robust Italian style espresso, which contrasts with the trend for citrusy single origin shots that are on offer in a number of cafes at present. 

The latte that I ordered had smooth foam, and a large serving size. It was quite mild, but the underlying espresso shot was muted rather than being completely lost, and could easily be detected in the aftertaste.  This may be the result of the larger espresso shot sizes mentioned earlier. The overall character was of coffee rather than milk, so despite the serving size, it avoids the easy mistake of serving warm caffeinated warm milk, rather than coffee. The foam maintained it's integrity throughout, without breaking up - a small detail, but one that's consistent with correct steaming temperature and duration, and something that I've seen a few cafes get wrong in recent weeks.

There is a good coffee menu on offer, with the usual combinations of espresso and milk, and brewed coffees. One thing that differs is the presence of shakerato on the menu (a shaken cold espresso), that I have not seen before, and something that I'm genuinely curious to see made. Prices were as expected, at 8.50 for the latte and espresso above.

Overall, La Ristretto's is interesting in that they are serving something genuinely different, and it's an opportunity to try a fairly authentic Italian espresso. The location may be an issue for some, in that it's in the middle of a medical centre, rather than in a standalone cafe. This should not deter you from visiting during non peak hours however, especially if you happen to be in the area. However do bear in mind that the cafe itself is quite small, so please let patients and staff take priority!"

Let me start this review by saying I am not a coffee drinker. I grew up grinding coffee beans for my mum and brewing them in a french press and somehow the overdose of aromas, maybe the bitter overtones, turned me off coffee. I am also highly sensitive to caffeine and sugar since I drink water and eat fresh food where possible.  Oh and of course that time I had a latte at a Starbucks in a central Singapore location and it gave me the worst stomach ache a few hours later (they apologized, said it was the milk and offered vouchers - which was sweet, but I wasn't about to get myself sick again). 

All this to say that when I DO choose to drink a coffee, it has to look really inviting and pleasurable. Jewel Coffee does just that. I enjoy wine and analyzing it so this is the best I can piece apart the coffee at Jewel. The red velvet latte is made of brewed coffee from one country, steamed milk and then some red velvet powder. There isn't any sugar added so you can do what you please at the condiment station. 

In wine, a single grape variety can deliver a good profile of flavors without the haphazardness of a blend of grapes. I'm not partial to both but it's interesting to taste each variety on it's own. It seems the same way with coffee beans - I picked beans with some coffee tones and a mild ""rust"" to it, and it was a great base for the red velvet powder. Having tried the red velvet latte a few times now, opt for the full fat milk and not the skimmed. It makes a huge difference to the acidity of the drink. I really enjoyed the latte and as mentioned, I've had a few times since. I can only drink about half a cup before the caffeine kicks get too much, but my partner gladly finishes the other half (no pun intended). 

Jewel also carries some interesting pastries. There's a salted caramel something and a gula melaka croissant...both of which were quite good. Though I wish they were fresh and warm without asking. There are some quirky bags for sale as well in the merchandise section that perhaps one day, when I'm high enough on coffee, I will actually buy.

The last perk about Jewel is that this outlet has great seating space that allows you to talk business without being overheard (some of the other options in the mall have very packed seating). I would request that they put in some arm chairs or more comfortable chairs though. There is also another Jewel Coffee outlet that I shall not name that is fantastic on the weekends for chilling in and watching the world go by. Residents who live nearby are already clued in and I'm not about to give the lobang away, but it has lots of sunlight streaming in, couches/tables/work counters and as mentioned above, the food and beverages aren't bad at all. 

In other words, I think I have found a coffee chain to my liking. Yours truly, a non-coffee drinker."

It's easy to get to in Orchard yet it is buried deep enough in a quiet shopping mall. I've been here a couple of times during dinner when it gets really crowded but other times I've never had to wait to be seated in the afternoons.

The owners of PS Cafe branched out from fashion and that elegance has translated into the interior decor of the restaurant. Dark wood interiors that incorporate big floral arrangements added to a semi-open kitchen and a row of delightfully tempting cakes housed in glass covers, you get the idea.

I'm usually very predictable with my orders at PS Cafe and that is because I love the Portobello Mushroom Soup, Caesar Salad and Truffle Shoestring Fries. I'm gladly boring for such good food."

You get sushi rolls and $26 entrees and the standard Asian fusion appetizers. We tried the chirashi bowl, ramen aglio olio with foie gras and smoked duck, as well as the miso cod.

The miso cod was really good, portion size is pretty small but unsurprising given how miso cods are always served in really tiny portions in restaurants. I tried making miso cod once, and to stick it to restaurants' faces I made quite a large portion, and it ended up kinda jelat with all the sweet seasoning, so maybe that's why. TFS's miso cod was very tender and well marinated, would definitely recommend it if you're half hungry. Otherwise it'll only make you hungrier.

The ramen was somewhat of a disappointment. The smoked duck was too dry, I presume they sautéed it as well with the ramen but that process probably drained out some of the juices. There were 2 tiny tiny pieces of foie gras, which given the price of the dish seems slightly unreasonable. I mean it's literally fried instant ramen, so that's probably not where the cost went. That leaves the 3-4 pieces of smoked duck and 2 pieces of foie gras the size of my thumb. Which makes it the most expensive piece of foie gras I ever ate. 

The sushi looks fresh though, and their uni dishes look pretty good though I didnt try it. Basically, if you have cash to blow, definitely come here for the great sushi and fresh seafood. Otherwise, you'll be somewhat disappointed."

But alas, they are too good to keep quiet about. Previously i had come only for dinner, but now they do weekend brunches too. For dinner, I'd recommend the burgers, big portions, be warned. But my fav is the iberico pork ribs, so tasty, so tender. 

Apparently, for weekday breakfast, they are converted into a coffee shop, so local kopi, chee cheong fun, chwee kuey, the works. They've also recently had a prata store join them, which i sampled. Good prata, the crispy type. 

For brunch, i had the pork in Duxelle + brioche. Let's just say i wiped the plate clean. Very clean. They probably didn't have to wash it. But I'm sure they did.  

If there's anything to complain about, it's probably the coffee. On the weekends, no kopi, only espresso type coffee, which can always be tricky. Need a good barista for that. Not any issue for me at dinner i just drink beers, so give stars at dinner time. For breakfast, still 4.5 stars, the half  taken off for the coffee quality."

This was an introductory/first date.  The joys of a blind date.  So, we selected a casual place.

The staff was friendly, polite, and professional.

The ambiance really speaks to being a classic tea room.  Plus, with the glass walls you can see everything that is going on around you in the mall.  But it does have a touch of a feeling of having a meal in an aquarium.

VEAL BLANQUETTE (Rich veal stew served with button mushrooms and baby onions in lemon cream sauce infused with Mistral Tea.) - This was a rather bland dish.  It didn't really stand out at all.  I wouldn't order it again.

Overall - For something casual, it will work.  I certainly do not consider it a destination spot though.  But, if you are in the mall, and want a bite to eat, dessert, or tea, I think that this TWG Tea Salon is a decent, if not spectacular, option."

This is all within like 10 minutes apart. when the savory snack arrived, I moved the cake to the side to eat the snack first. Halfway through it, I realized the cake was missing! We completely did not see the waitress clear it, but we only had 3 bites and it was such a waste to clear. We informed her it was a mistake and she said she assumed we didn't want it since we put it to the side (Just ask next time!). She was apologetic and said she would get it back. 

You wouldn't believe what she did next. She brought half a slice of the cake. A half slice! We were weirded out. I mean, what is she going to do with the other half? I thought that was completely cheap. We were like huh? And she told us it's because we ate almost half of the cake (not true) but whatever, the cake was ok tasting but not worth this rubbish! 

If they can be so cheap, you won't want to know what lame ingredients they may be using.

And by grandfather, I mean the one that sits in an armchair with trousers up to his armpits demanding that one of his grandchildren fetches his slippers.

Let me explain. To counter all these recycled wood and faux-industrial whipper snappers, Oriole still looks like it's stuck in the early 2000s. Even its menu is an unashamed mish-mash of random pastas and sandwiches. No trendy avocado mashes or pork cheek brioche burger benedicts here! Just good old Philly cheese steak and... potato wedges. Remember potato wedges? They can probably still be found on the menu of your local Harry's-style after-work watering hole. And at Oriole.

So that accounts for grandpa's unfashionable attire. Oriole has been there long enough (and has real-estate on Orchard prime-enough - comfortable armchair) to not care. And the coffee is still pretty good, it certainly cuts it better than some of these upstarts. None of the baristas have waxed mustaches or clubmaster glasses, nor do they wear the latest chambray shirts, but they are working with locally roasted coffee, not inferior Genovese.

So these  grandkids of Oriole should not only fetch the slippers but kneel down and kiss the ring. Maybe Palheta roasts better and maybe Common Man is more popular with the couples brunch crowd. But Oriole blazed this trail long before and was grinding & steaming while they were still nappy-clad dreams in their owners' minds. Respect it."

I've never fancied muffins to be very tempting, they often look very dull, very standard, and rarely as colourful as cupcakes. But the muffinry cupcakes...are of a different class. They seem to possess that little home-made goody quality that implores me to explore them beyond their outer shell. I duly did that with my now favourite fig and earl grey muffin, and have never looked back. 

An absolutely glorious cupcake if I'd ever had one. The earl grey taste was fantastic, and its cirtus qualities brought out by two fairly sizable bits of fig that quite literally spiced up the cupcake. The consistency of the cupcake was formidable again, crumbling perfectly, though not annoyingly. With such skill to make such a good cupcake, I'm already looking forward to my next one."

Can I just say that Firebake Woodfired Bakehouse and Restaurant is my favorite dining spot in the East? I've been waiting with bated breath ever since I heard that Konstantino (or Tino) is gonna open up a place to sell his kickass sourdough bread made. Plus this passionate man was building a full-scale woodfire oven just so that he can bake his breads in (how's that for passion)! Of course, you can expect that I made many rounds around their block so that I can be the first to check them out when they open.

Tino is truly an artisan who is devoted to his craft. From raw ingredients to firewood to water, everything is as non-processed, sustainable, and close to its natural state as possible. Organic flour, natural non-iodised and non-processed salt, water that has been treated using Firebake's elaborate Nordaq Fresh water filtration system, all these pure ingredients go into the making of a perfect loaf. 
Of course, there's more to just freshly baked breads here. The menu here features contemporary dishes cooked with traditional European techniques, which complement and showcase the range of woodfire baked sourdough bread. 

But first, bread! For first timers, the Firebake Bread Board with Greek extra virgin olive oil and the special Norwegian Roros Smor cultured butter ($10) is a great way to sample the different sourdoughs. There's the fluffy and chewy white which is perfect with the pate; a wholesome wholemeal with caraway which is lovely with the butter; a triple fermented rye for making a satisfying sandwich; and a fruit with plump sultanas and apricots that is perfect on its own or with more butter. The breads are also available in loaves ($8-13) and trust me they will be gone in no time.

You can make a meal out of just the bread, but make sure there's space for the rest! The 4-Spice Chicken Liver Pate ($12) is a smooth one, made with an equal ratio of butter. I love how it spreads beautifully on the white sourdough. It is also served with another slice of fruit loaf if you're into the sweet and savory combination.

Other refreshing appetizers that make perfect pairings with the breads include a Mediterranean style cold Smoked Eggplant ($15) with spiced hummus, tomato and Manchego.

The Heirloom Tomatoes ($17), provide bursts of flavor with smoked oil, feta, pickled cucumber and other aromatics. The mix is soaked overnight in tomato jus to enhance its flavor. Of course, sourdough croutons go into this one.

My favorite is the Wood-fired Pumpkin with Burrata ($16)! My mouth is watering just thinking about the creamy buffalo cheese with a sprinkle of pistachio dukkah, orange blossom, and a touch of molasses. In fact, I had this as my main on an occasion. 

Favorite must-have main? The Cured Norwegian Salmon ($23). Love that pink in the center and how smoky it is. Plus that bread crust for added texture and some grassy sauteed leeks to go with. 

The Norwegian Blue Mussels ($25) is cooked in Golden Ale (rather than wine), and flavored with chorizo and butter. I found this a bit bland and the only flavor was from the bits of chorizo (and only when i bit into them).

The Australian Prawn Capellini Aglio Olio with Sakura Ebi ($19) has an amazing aroma from the grilled prawns and prawn oil. I would love for punchier flavor (garlic and spice) but the pure seafood fragrance becomes more pronounced as you chew on it. Maybe give it a sprinkle of salt to enhance the dish a little.

The Grilled Pork Belly ($22) with garden vegetable broth is what i'd reach for on a cold night. The vegetable broth is like a clear sweet minestrone, all naturally flavored by the pumpkin and celeriac. The sous-vide pork is given the cast iron grill treatment before being served and that crunchy skin is yums. The pork is kinda porky (if you know what i mean), so not all may take to this. 

Another hit is the Rangers Valley Striploin of Wagyu grade A3! A 300gm slab for only $38? COUNT ME IN.

Firebake Bread and Butter pudding ($10) is so damn good please. Make sure you call and reserve it as they only serve 12 a night currently! This is made using their fruit loaf and soaked with creme anglais. It's a small bowl, but it goes a long way..

For a lighter but nevertheless sweet ending, go with the Moscato Poached Peach with a sourdough ice cream (SAY WERT) and rye chips ($12). The ice cream is a little like yogurt, with the nice pull to it.

Head on over to Firebake for the rustic dishes and lovely breads. They also serve a special blend of coffee from Jimmy Monkey, and there's also nitro-coffee available. For drinks of an alcoholic nature, there are affordable craft beers, and boutique wines to complement your meal. Alternatively, sip on some Nordaq Fresh water (still or sparkling) for $3/4 (free flow). Firebake is now open for dinner and they have just started a weekend brunch service too! GO NAOOOO!"

It has a monochrome interiors with black and white tiled wall and furniture. A look different from the modern industrial look that most newly opened cafes take on. This one feels like a traditional coffee shop given a modern twist. 
 
Opened early this year, it serves mainly coffee, tea and cakes, as it lacks a proper kitchen. I enjoyed my flatwhite that late morning, it was not too heavy with a caramel undertone. They serve their house blend. I chose their carrot cake (with pineapple and cranberries) that was moist and not to sweet.  

The lady serving us at the counter was friendly, and so was the owner. He did not mind having a small chat, and mentioned that they are working with a social enterprise to bring in sandwiches soon. Hope it works out for them, as I will return for their coffee and it will be good to be able to get a small bite at the same time if I need to."

I've heard so much of 2am dessert bar in the last few years that I'm amazed I never actually went. Today being singapore's 50th, I simply had to honour the day with a little patriotism and find out what all the fuss (about chef Janice Wong) is about. 

Since I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on this place, I'm going to write this one a little differently. Here are some things I've heard and my opinion:
1. Overpriced, atas, not worth the price: I'll admit it is expensive but tonight was the first night my hippie of a boyfriend said an expensive high end place I brought him to was worth the price and he'd bring his parents someday. This is the first among a string of award-winning, rave-reviews-earning restaurants around parts of the world we've lived in or travelled to. So, you can decide for yourself if it is overpriced after trying it out too! The chances are that you'll come to the same conclusion as us. There is a minimum spending per person on certain days though!
2. Tacky: I don't know what classifies as tacky anymore, what with the hipsters thinking everything is tacky if it is not old in a cool way, so if you ask me, this place is about as cool as it gets. It has a nice bar vibe without being too noisy or busy.
3. Overhyped: Chef Janice Wong is good, quite simply put. I didn't believe I could be so in love with every dish I had but I am. I wish I could be her, making pretty confectionery and insanely creative food installations.

The great positives that earned that last star on the review:
1. They mixed up our order and gave us a free tart. We ordered the green tea tart, and they gave us the chocolate tart on the house. They could easily have taken it back, but I'm glad they did not because it was good and I'll go back for more now.
2. The wine/cocktail pairings were quite on point. A rich chocolate dessert balanced with sorbet and served with a decent red wine was just such a great combination. 
3. They apologised for any inconsistency even though we would never have known or minded anyway. These apologies included the different plate used from the norm for one dish and change in flavour of the cocktail. 
4. Interesting and well-paired flavours in each dish ensured that my impression wasn't marred by the fact that one dish was simply too weird, boring or terrible. The lavender marshmallows were subtle but still had a hint of lavender, ideal for such a strong flavour, while the strong matcha was lightened by the rice sorbet and the dark chocolate was made less intense and rich by the evian.
5. They have $5 churros that were actually decent and tasted like what you'd get in Europe. Enough said.
6. The very friendly staff were constantly smiling and made us feel really welcome and comfortable. 

If you have never tried this place, I'd strongly recommend heading down maybe for a special occasion if you can't justify the spending. The place is small but I don't think it's too busy. Even on sg50 night, we didn't have to wait for seats. There isn't a dress code either thankfully, and is very aptly relaxed and friendly; I wouldn't call it too posh at all!"

Tong Heng's egg tarts belong firmly in the latter category.

The custard filling is slightly wobbly, not too much, just enough to titillate but still solid enough to require biting through. There I was half slurping the eggy custard held in its incredibly crisp and fluffy tart cup, not being able to get over the fact that I only found out about Singapore's best egg tart quarter of a century later.

Tong Heng also sells gai zai beng (very rarely found in Singapore anymore) and some other confectionaries which I didn't pay attention to."

I liked they ask if you want breast meat for the chicken or thigh.  I GATE dark meat, so this was a bit sell for me.  $12.50 gave me a full chicken breast with broccoli, edamame, brown rice, and mushrooms with a sesame peanut dressing. You can also get a topping (almonds, chia, ect, but I oped for none.  It was exactly what I needed after a killer spin class.  Good price, quality food."

That was the BEST dessert to EVER hit my tongue. I can't believe it. It was hot, moist, just the right density, the sauce was perfectly caramelly with just a little saltiness, and the vanilla bean icecream completed the whole thing. Like, man. That was so good. 

Two things to know before dining here: if it's busy, you might wait 40+mins for food, and if you're sitting outside, bring mosquito repellent. There's not many bugs out there, but if you're like me and happen to be a walking Mozzie Buffet, sitting right by the jungle can be an....er, interesting experience. 

HOWEVER. The food here is great! I absolutely LOVED their Pad Thai Salad - the prawns were tender and well cleaned, the veggies were fresh and crunchy, and the peanut sauce and flavourful spices were delicious. 10/10 would order again. I also loved their ranges of Gin - the subtle tastes and flavours were really fun to explore. 

Tried the truffle fries and honestly don't have too much to say. They were pretty average, and the first batch we had to send back to the kitchen because they were stone cold :/ the hot ones were nice enough, but I wouldn't order them again. 

Also, I've already raved about their Sticky Date, but we also grabbed PS's specialty brownie...which actually wasn't that great, to be honest! It looks FASCINATING, stacked a mile high with huge fluffy marshmallows and covered with ganache, but the brownie itself was more the consistency of a sponge, and it was sickeningly sweet. Even the ice cream wasn't enough of a break between the hectic chocolate gooeyness, so we all ended up going cross-eyed from sugar overload and only eating 1/4 of the slice all up. Considering the calibre of the other meals we ordered, this one was a bit of a disappointment. 

Service: 4/5 stars
Food: 4/5 stars overall
Atmosphere: 5/5 stars
Speed: 1.5/5 stars on a busy day."

While Liang Court has long lost its former edge of glory over the years, it still remains as the representative Japanese mall with tenants Meidi-ya, Kinokuniya, Marutama, Saizeriya Ristorante and Tampopo holding the business together (anybody remembers Daimaru?). There is another reason to pay them a visit - Dulcet & Studio.

Dulcet & Studio is a whole new lifestyle café, with a contemporary yet cosy vibes - think Muji in a restaurant form. The name 'Dulcet' means sweet to the taste, while 'Studio' is the other part of the café where customers can sign up for cooking classes. 

Expect a mixture of Western meets Japanese cuisine including specialty pasta, lamb rice, beef spare rib stew, fish & chip. Lunch and dinner sets are served at a very reasonable price of below $15 and $20 respectively.

I much preferred the Black Pig Bolognese Fettuccine Pasta ($12.80) which reminds me of tomato based bak chor mee pok. The meat sauce is salty-sweet, and ladies would appreciate this as it does not leave you overwhelmed or over-full for lunch."

Customer Service could be better. On a weekday around 2 pm, there were 3 servers just standing around. Not very welcoming. Tables and seats were not properly cleaned as there were crumbs on the seats and table was wet.

They did top up our water cups which was good.

Egg croissant was okay. The scrambled eggs were cooked and seasoned perfect but the croissant was flaky but too soft so eggs made it soggy.

Chocolate mint drink was not bad.

Desserts could be better. Took a while to get it - perhaps had to wait to get it from next door sister bakery. Got the hazelnut tart and the ""hummingbird"" cake which is basically just banana bread with tiny pineapple chunks in it.

Just another cafe in the area which is a nice option but nothing special."

There is incredible variety of food, but I'm going to give a review specifically of Wen Wen pork rib prawn Mee stall 01-147. We had a steamboat of crab, prawns, clams, pork ribs, intestines and pig tails. The base stock was crazy good with intense flavors of prawn and pork. After the ingredients were eaten, the stock became extra rich with even more intense flavors, this time with crab and clams into the mix. The owner is Richard, a thoroughly nice guy. The place and ambience is well, hawker center. But here you can also bring your own stuff, vegetables, abalone or whatever and just throw into the pot. Richard won't charge you extra. Highly recommended and very affordable. One hint, better come before October 2017 as he will move to Kallang market."

Auntie sells a total of two type of Herbal Tea. Bitter and Sweet. I can only take the sweet one. Natural sweetener is added for health purpose. Sweetness is just the right amount and no taste of bitter herbal tea.

As for the bitter one, my advise is you need to have some courage to try. It cost $1 more than the sweet one probably become of the additional chinese herbs added. The one and last chance I had trying the bitter one was cause someone told me bitter one if more effective. I choked on the first mouth due to the very very very bitter taste. And for some time, the taste just doesn't leave your mouth. That is when I deduct by my own logic that Herbal tea no matter sweet or bitter, the effect is the same.

The bitter herbal tea was also use to play this game of drinking without changing your expression. I always lose making the ugliest face expression. But boyfriend doesn't stop amuse me when there wasn't a slight change in his expression.

I will still get from this stall everytime I am at Old Airport Road."

At the coffee shop, you can enjoy western food and a variety of local favorites. My favorite thing to order is the SDC Club Salad with the Satay Peanut Sauce for a dressing. The salad came with roast beef, hard boiled egg, ham and cheese. It usually comes with a thousand island dressing but I opted for the lovely satay sauce. The sauce is meant for beef and chicken marinated skewers, but I love it it the salad. They also have a fabulous chili sauce and condiment station. They have a prawn belacan that is to die for. The vegetarian version and Hainanese chicken rice chili is good too but the prawn version is my fave.

They have a nice Hainanese Chicken Rice, Chicken Biryani, tau pok, Rojak also. I was so happy to be invited to enjoy the SSC. Dad enjoys the billiard room. They have a pretty koi pond, too."

Popular among the local as well as the tourist, you can expect this place to be buzzing. 

Some of the things to look forward here are the famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice (stall #10-11), Fuzhou Oyster Omelette (stall #5) as well as their Marina South's Char Kway Teow (stall #35). Everything we had was delightful and guaranteed to induce food coma. To wash down the grease, there are also many fruit shake stalls, but my suggestion is you gotta try their sugar cane... So refreshingly sweet!

*Tips: Use Favepay to get 10% rebate for next use. So one person pay with the same favepay account 1 by 1, this way the 2nd person that is the 2nd bowl only pay $9. This way you'll save $1 for the 2nd person / bowl straight away rather than have to wait for next time coming back to be able to use the $1 rebate. Because you might not come back again before it's 3 months expiry. Enjoy

I really don't.  I agree with a previous reviewer: Why is every single place in Singapore which serves good tasting, real food combined with good service expensive? Seriously, Singapore: you are raising your children to believe that healthy, locally sourced food is only for the elite? That giving good service and being polite comes at a price?

That being said, I am happy that places as Open Farm Community exist and that I can afford going there now and then. The food is delicious and the service is how it should be. The watercress-kale soup is really good, but for 19$ I expect no less. I do wonder though: the other dish we had was beef rib eye: where do they source cows in Singapore?

To me, Open Farm Community needs to seriously walk the talk. Their website reads that they want to connect the community to nature and  celebrate local spirit. In addition to being on the costly side, their location is not reachable without a car.  In a country where a lot of people do not own a car, this is not really helping to reach the local community.

5 stars for the food & service but 3 stars for a concept mismatch so 4 stars overall."

For starters, Nespresso coffee is hands down the best mass-produced coffee available on the market at a reasonable cost. Each sleeve costs about $18 for 7 capsules of coffee. They have 10 standard flavors available and are constantly finding new roasts marketing them as ""limited additions."" The store has a beautiful selection of machines, ranging from professional to every day at home use. They also have a selection of cups and other accessories to compliment your purchase.

The best part, of course, is the fact that customers can come in and try out any flavor of coffee, for free! The service is excellent and the staff are very knowledgeable on all the flavors. They prepare your coffee very well, to your tastes, as an expresso or with milk.

At first is a bit confusing, the name suggests a market, and they do sell a few (overpriced) fruits and vegetables, but it can also appear as a bakery, cafe, restaurant, takeaway or souvenir store. They seem to have a bit of everything.

As a restaurant they have few tables outside where they serve an interesting menu. Ambitious might be the proper word to describe it. They have common dishes, mostly Western, but made with a slight, almost imperceptible, twist, mainly done by adding a touch of a different flavour, which lifts the plate. For example, the sweet potato fries come with a well-balanced curry mayonnaise. More importantly, the food I've had there a couple of times is done with care and precision. Prices seem rather high, but portions are on the generous side, so I think they're fair (it's Robertson Quay anyway). Burgers are big and delicious, and pasta is served in more than enough amounts. Mainstream beers are expensive at 10++ for a miserable half pint, but they have good craft beers at the same price for a bottle. Coffee is not bad, but nothing to rave about. Cakes are tasty, worth trying. An important thing is they make an effort in offering more local products rather than imports, maybe they could make that more explicit.

Inside the shop, there are three tables that serve as a cafe, and there's a shelf that showcases souvenirs of the interesting kind, I'm talking about Singlish ""dictionaries"" and Teochew recipe books instead of Merlion keychains. While these quirky souvenirs are quickly becoming mainstream, they also sell books by Math Paper Press, which are truly good local gifts.

SPRMKT has a little bit of many different things and, sometimes, it's not quite clear what to expect. It is, after all, a place to have a nice dining experience and find some amusing local products. It is worth a try, the food is better than it would seem."

We got lost on our first visit, cause we didn't really have much time as 'nature called.' But anyway, just a tip, if you're driving, turn into the parking lot of block 128 and immediately turn right after wards. Just follow the road and the shop is just tucked away at the corner.

I have tried many ice cream shops all over the world and I have to say that Creamier is up there on my list. You can just feel that the ice cream was very finely made. It was very smooth and, true to its name, very creamy. I think it is slightly too sweet but it was not overwhelming. The flavors were also quite creative. I had the salted gula Melaka and earl grey lavender. Both were just absolutely wonderful.

I had the ice cream with waffle and it was well made too. It was too crispy for me tbh, but I can understand that most people will like it. I'm just one of those oddballs who prefer his waffles without any crispiness to it. If you're like me, let the ice cream sog down the waffles first, let it absorb those delicious goodies before devouring it.

I can't wait to go back to Singapore and try the other flavors from Creamier."

'The Lox' comes with pickled beets that are freakishly pink and delicious. Other innovative sandwiches are also great. 

Tbh these bagel sandwiches get a little messy and filling, but it's Singapore and if you're looking for bagels, it's really only here or Sacha and Son's in my book. (But plz let me know if you find anything else!!!!!)

At first thought the name was d'gold cafe, but I'm closer inspection the 'l'  is actually a coffee bean. 

The place wasn't too crowded, about 60% filled. But noticed a celebrity seated near the bar with his family. On display are many mugs signed with well wishes from other celebrities, so maybe I the cafe is owned by a celebrity?

Was given 2 menus by the waiter. 1 is a food menu and the other a drinks menu. This is quite common, but the drinks menu is like 5 times thicker than the food menu. Haa... Although I always order the same old ice tea or ice latte, I decided to check out the drinks menu anyway. The selection of teas is really... Wah...  Also don't know how to describe. You come once a week for the rest of the year, and you probably would not have tried all the teas yet. Anyway, the boring person that I am, I tried the old English iced tea,and it was pretty delicious. Definitely not BOH or lipton brand..  

Back to food, I ordered the pork cheek whilst my wife ordered the Crispy salmon. Both were fantastic. Portion abit small but it leaves just enough room in your stomach for dessert. Which is probably the goal because when a pair of girls came and sat beside us, they were already chittering away about the cheesecake. One of them sat down, looked at the cake display and exclaimed ""what? Only 2 cakes left? That's it, Im not going to order a main, I'm just eating cake."". She meant it too. They didn't order anything else, just the last 2 slices of cheesecake. 

I can't say much for the cake, I didn't get to try it. But from where I was sitting it looked pretty good. Nothing fancy about it. Just a classic, tall, moist cheesecake. 

All in all, full marks from every aspect. The service staff are friendly, prompt and attentive. They don't charge for water. Food is good and served in a timely manner and at the same time. Comfortable and stylish ambience. And perhaps some chance to score a look at some celebrities. 

To summarise, pretentious food without the hefty price tag."

I've been to almost all of the Lupicia tea shops (except Taiwan, Australia, and a few stores in Japan). This one in Singapore is inside the Great City Mall! It's a bit small compared to the Paris and Honolulu ones! But the staff was really helpful and friendly as always! I sampled the Calamansi tea since it's the only one you can get at the Singapore Lupicia! It was like drinking hot lime tea! lol! The staff recommended serving it cold like an iced tea! I bought a tin of the Calamansi and a box of the Fan Dance (Chinese New Year edition) all for about $29USD!

If you're into finding exclusive Lupicia teas, I also recommend visiting the Isetan Drymarket on Scotts Road. The store is a bit hidden on the Sports Level. But they have exclusive Lupicia teas (Spice Garden, Durian Green, Miss Vanda, Royal Bandung) made just for Isetan Singapore!!! A neat find! :)"

1. Guanaja souffle: Luxuriously dark and full-bodied chocolate flavour throughout, but at the same time extraordinarily light and fluffy. Loved it. Wasn't too sweet, and came with a small jug of vanilla sauce that wasn't that sugary either and complemented it very well. 
There was also raspberry sorbet on the side. I thought that was too sweet but my companion liked the pairing. It's not sweeter than the average fruit sorbet, so ymmv with this one.

2. After 8 souffle: Came with a small plastic dropper that had mint liqueur inside, and a jug of decadent thick dark chocolate sauce. We didn't know whether the souffle was flavoured, and our server told us to squeeze the dropper, so our mint ended up all concentrated in one spot.
The souffle turned out to be plain, more like a stage for the chocolate + mint. If we'd known this, we probably would have spread out the mint a bit more! The chocolate sauce was so good I ate it on its own and then felt like a pig. 

3. Venezuela hot chocolate: Was really good. The thickness was creamy and satisfying, not one of those watery versions you get elsewhere. Flavour was also strong and even. 

4. Ginger lemonade: This had actual ginger slices in the lemonade, though the ginger taste wasn't extremely strong. Refreshing after all that chocolate."

The food is not that exceptional, but there's a huge variety all in one place, so you're guaranteed to find something you like. We got satay (which is on the street side), basil chicken, pork on noodles and char keay teow. Everything was tasty, but I definitely have favorite places to go for many of these dishes. We also got yummy sugar cane juice. Yum!

Seating can be difficult, especially if you have a large group, so you have to hawk dive for tables sometimes. This is definitely a very Singaporean experience that everyone should experience!"

The food/dessert offerings are alright. However, with Awfully Chocolate, Ice Cream Chef, and the hawker centre a stone throw away, I would prefer to just order coffee here. 

Since It's not easy to come here, the place doesn't get too crowded on most days. They don't offer free wifi or charging point (that I know of), so come with a fully charged laptop. Alternatively, just sit back, sip on the great coffee and read a book."

I opted for the Italian Seafood Marinara ($7.80) which was a decent-sized portion of pasta with squid, mussels and prawns in a delicious tomato sauce. Overall, very good value for money at a place that you would expect mains to be in the $10+ price range. However, the mussels were terrible - rubbery, overcooked and probably not fresh.

A Malaysian brand 'theme' restaurant, walking it is a series of unexpected surprises.

When you first step in the space looks almost like a kids playpark, step further into the dining area and the first thing that caught my eye was an entire corner decked out as a bridal studio! Gowns, mannequins, flowers, and cutesy stuffed toys... After I sat down I then realised there was also a live band setting up!

The decor feels like a combination of a maid-cafe, garden themed restaurant, and bridal studio! Apparently it's also a wedding hall. I hope so, since they don't look like they do very well on walk-ins for the cafe part of the space.

I was just meeting a friend so I can't comment on the food, but service was polite, and the space was just so charming!

Really hope to come back in the future! :)

So when I heard about this new restaurant with the interesting name I thought I'd try it.
Ostensibly it's a salad place.  Which sounded good to me.  The problem was in the execution of, well, pretty much everything.  It took about fifteen minutes to get our drinks served, and another 15 to get our salads.  This despite the fact that there were only a few diners there.   The salads consisted of wilted lettuce that looked like it had gone bad a few days ago.  Veggies that were either past their peak or poorly chosen.   And flavorlessly cooked beef and chicken.   It seems the owners put too much effort into being hip hipster hippies and not enough into learning how to choose ingredients and cook them properly.
To sum it up: Bad, slow service.  Terrible food.   

With so many great places to eat nearby, coming here is a foolhardy mistake.
Cross it off your list.  This is one place that needs to be economically Darwined out of existence."

I asked :) 

Even their waffles are vegan, using no eggs or cows milk, and yet it was still delicious. I had 2 scoops of ice cream and a waffle, and by the end of finishing everything, I wasn't like super full or bloated, but I was definitely satisfied. Less guilt, and totally satisfied. That's a pretty good feeling coming out of an ice cream shop. 

The service is also THE NICEST I have come across in Singapore, shocking to say since this is an ice cream shop. All smiles and super sweet. 

They also serve free flow alkaline water with a high ph. I don't know any other ice cream shop, let alone restaurant that serves free flow alkaline water. Do you?!"

It's 2.5 stars (but not quite 3) in my opinion. 

Let's just say, the concept is good but the execution just well, kinda sucked, for lack of a better word.

Food: I got the Hearty Breakfast, and wasn't the least impressed (especially because I was at Arbite the weekend before, and they, they do a mean hearty breakfast - but more on that in another review!) the portions in general just seemed small all around (except for the local options) which would be fine if it tasted amazing but everything just seemed subpar. I also tried bites of the Mee Siam and the Ham & Cheese Panini. The Ham & Cheese Panini definitely tasted kind of like something I could've done myself, however, the Mee Siam was probably the best thing there in my opinion. It was hearty, with a nice sweet flavor to it. I enjoyed that the most. We also got the Honey Lemon Ice Tea which tasted like someone spilled half the jar of honey into. Did they?! 

Ambience: Like I said, great concept, horrible execution. They try to be ""cute"" with the cute nautical theme and selling old candies we grew up with but it just seems kind of copied. The seating inside is limited and pretty cramped and the service was alright. 

All in all, we left happy to have met everyone but not so happy with the food. Not horrible but really nothing special."

First discovered their tarts and pastries from the tiny neighbourhood store at Tanglin Halt - Fredo Galaxy some years ago, so when Drips opened up at Tiong Bahru (near me), I was thrilled. It's located a little away from the ""main attraction"" streets where 40 Hands, Books Actually, Tiong Bahru Bakery, Orange Thimble are... so it's usually less crowded, a good thing if you're just looking for somewhere to sit down without having to queue or jostle with others.

Drips dons a modern, white-tiled, high ceiling decor, a nice space to chill but honestly, not one that I dine-in frequently. I do swing by often enough to get their tarts to-go for friends' home parties, picnics, birthdays and such, but that's about it. Looking pass the pastries display to the menu on the wall, you'll find there isn't much else that excites - a tiny selection of sandwiches, coffees and tea-bag teas, mostly somewhat overpriced.

I will still highly recommend Drips for their tarts and cakes, but for a tea time outing that's a little less damaging to your pocket, here's what I usually do: have your pick and splurge on one of their delicate bakes, pack it up in a box... then hop on over to Tiong Bahru Food Centre, order a local soul-warming cup of Teh (milk tea), find a nice big table and dig it.

We had the mentaiko salmon pasta, the salmon pho and the salted egg mochi w ice cream. For the price, portions of the mains aren't particularly large, but maybe the restaurant's strategy is to leave room for dessert! 

The mentaiko salmon pasta was done perfectly. Al dente pasta, al dente salmon and creamy mentaiko. Mmm mmm mmm! The salmon pho, is a completely different dish. The broth and noodles are delicate, but the salmon was a tad overdone. Otherwise, it's a really nice dish. The salted egg mochi was ah-mazing! I dont know if any other restaurants do it, but it's definitley a heart stopper. They also give 3 mochis, so be prepared to fight if sharing between an even number of people!"

They didn't even tell us that my iced latte needed sugar, and didn't direct me to where the sugar was.

Price: only 2.20 SGD for one egg tart. 

Atmosphere: We came in in the middle of the day when it was very hot, there was a seating area where you could enjoy your treats that was air conditioned and it was a perfect break from the sweltering heat in chinatown.

Tips: They sell a variety of baked goods other than egg tarts!"

Opens till late on Fridays and Saturdays, so you can pop over here for a sit and rest after bustling your way through Little India and Mustafa Shopping Centre.

They describe their offerings as ""not overly fussy"" and ""served with warmth"" and that's quite an apt description. The baked foods look good with none of that ""look at me I'm an exquisite dessert"" nonsense and there's quite a wide variety of product on offer. 

While I haven't tried most of the food on the menu, I can tell you that the Salted Caramel Nutella Tart is a sweet-tooth-satisfying crunch, the Chicken Ham & Egg Toast Cup is a unexpectedly comforting chomp, and the Muddy Mud Cake is probably the best chocolate cake I've had in a cafe. Served warm, the Muddy Mud Cake is a delicious gobble that is just moist enough and the right amount of dense that makes for a toothsome chomp that isn't pound-cake heavy nor fleetingly airy.

The Lemonade Jar is a nice refreshing sip but disappointingly, the lemonade doesn't get served in the jar. It's poured out into the large glass with ice instead, which is a perfectly acceptable way to enjoy lemonade. But the jars just look so inviting in the counter.  Anyway, there is also a range of coffees and teas and the usual suspects on the drink menu. 

Butter Studio isn't very large, but it's a cosy, comforting space. You can chill solo or come with your friends for a quiet chat, or for some board or card games that you can find for free use at the corner of the cafe. They host crafty workshops and performances every once in a while too."

It is of open concept like those modern cafes and kiosks in malls. The menu has a number of food to choose from and i think the cuisine they serve there has a mix of Chinese, western and malay.
I think their food are valued for money and really quite tasty, and also they give pretty big portions of each dish. My friend had ordered the fish and chips and the fish was huge, it came along with chunky fries too, nicely fried. I had one of their aglio olio and the side dishes that came along with it were plentiful i was surprised for the price i was paying.

The boss and staff there were very friendly and they really did their best to provide good service to customers. I would definitely recommend people to dine here as it is a really casual cafe and good service plus food, must try."

Instead of keeping the similar type of decoration, the Bao Makers stripped everything to white. From the outside the café stood out quite well due to the colour.
 
On the inside, they also kept the minimalistic industrial look with the cemented walls and wooden furnitures, perfect for hipsters to hangout.
 
We visited the Bao Makers on the last day of our holiday when we were quite full from our previous dinner, but at the back of my mind I always remembered my conversation with Em that I'd go and try the bao at this place. So without further contemplation I dragged hubby in and ordered two baos, the chili crab and Korean bulgogi pork.
 
I like both but the succulent and spicy chili crab definitely delivered more flavour especially with the crispy golden bao. I really like the idea of infusing the local dish into the bao, something that I never seen before at other places. The filling for both baos were sufficient.
 
Since Hubby was craving for dessert he also ordered a pretty serving of lemon meringue sundae. The meringue came as the topping in the shape of rose, the rest of the ingredients were lemon sponge, lemon curd and vanilla ice cream with almond slices. It was delicious but a bit awkward to be called a sundae except if you break the meringue and the sponge cake, then mix the whole thing together with the ice cream. 
 
We had a good time at the Bao Makers and we hope they will be a one stop shop for bao and able to come up with a lot of different fillings next time we go to Singapore."

I would give them a 4 but they legit pissed me off.  I ordered a slice of the Beyonce Lemonade cake (yeah I did). It came with a pretty peach buttercream rose on top, I finished half of it and asked them to box it up.  It was delicious. I have had better.  The lemon filling they use was on point but the cake left something to be desired. I think they use a butter cake recipe that lacks complexity (aka well balanced flavor). Anyways, I was planning on having it for breakfast with my morning coffee.  I like to start my day off by looking at something pretty and there was a very pretty buttercream rose on top of my slice when I handed it to them to box it up.  In the morning... I open up my little box and the rose was gone!!!! They took it off my slice before boxing it up!!

All the sandwiches came in sourdough bread and all were too greasy for our liking. Seems like it was buttered and thrown on to the hot plate. 
The meat on the club sandwiches was chunky and moist. The egg was over cooked but was ok. The vege was ok.

I would recommend their chocolate croissants as those are the only products from bread society that has not failed to disappoint time and time again. Their blueberry bread is not bad too but once again, I've had good and bad experiences with it. Their cakes did not impress on the 3 accounts, so if you are looking for quality cakes, go elsewhere."

Just like any hawkers center, you can move from stall to stall and sample all sorts of munchies and small meals to customize your own little repast. 

I stepped up to a chicken and rice stand, for what was something like my billionth serving of Singapore's signature dish. I enhanced this selection with a nice selection of satay from a nearby hawker stall. Squid and chicken satay? Why yes, I don't mind if I do. Smith Street also has clean seating on the side of the street, and they seem to do a nice job of cleaning up the tables as soon as someone leaves.

However, as good as Smith Street is, it can get a bit sticky for it is outside after all, and unlike a hawker stand, searching for a toilet can be a bit problematic. Still, besides a cornucopia munching to be had, Smith Street is also lined with a number of souvenir shops and specialty items; purchase some Chinese herbs for some old school healing. All and all, Smith Street is a nice change from a typical hawker center."

I swept sweet bakes like Vanilla & Raisin Swirl $3.50 & Orange Brioche off the shelve, and the former wins slightly but with low marks. The Danish presented in burnt rims, has a notable buttery flavor but not rich enough to remember. The sweet glaze blend gently with the flaky pastry partnering some scattered candies raisins. I wasn't really impressed with the taste, just mediocre.

The Orange Brioche $5.00, was weaker in taste. It didn't sing any buttery tune like other artisanal brioche, no signs of flakiness and rather dry in its texture. There was a small helping of citrus scented custard piped in the middle of the dough, mildly sweet. The orange fruit slice hindered my chewing - simply aesthetically pleasing on the the sweet bread.

The Madeleine $2.00/pc, was a decent piece. Not exceedingly sweet with a soft interior. I'd prefer it to be served warm like db Moderne Bistro so that I could taste the rich buttery structure in its comforting warmth. This one was left in the open, atop the pastry glass cabinet, side-by-side the Financiers. Obviously, it has been overpriced.

The Kumara & Bleu Tart $6.00/pc, champ the fleet in my whole selection when its rivals failed to compete well. The soft and crumbly tart shell adapted quite well to the sweet orange-pigmented kumara cubes gelled together in a pool of coagulated cheese - buttery rich and very delightful. Noticeable flavor is seen coming from the flaky tart, less from the filling.

The battle field continues to be less interesting when the limping Roast Chicken Sandwich $11.50, hit the ground. The fillet slices were dry and fibrous, no traces of flavor until my taste buds met up with the sweet onion chutney above the fresh lettuce. The hard-like-rock baguette made things worst, it was a total shame!

When I thought nothing will be praised, I was charmed by the healthier fare, $8.50 - Quinoa & Lentil Salads. The power grains are executed in perfection along with a mixture of soft lentil which is often undercooked. Carefully seasoned with the right amount of tang lending from the balsamic reduction and some sweet hints from the fresh apple slices, the rehydrated dried cranberry fruits, the heap of rocket greens woke my taste buds with a striking saltiness from the accompanying shaven Parmesan. Just as the episode starts to climax, I felt a cold gush of water came splashing down - the 2 sesame rolls that served alongside was rockier & rubbery than the earlier baguette! What's happening to the breads here? I let out a heavy sigh!"

The servings are massive, just like in The States, but the prices reflect the portion size. They have a lot of the classics here; pancakes, eggs on toast, a big breakfast etc. I thought they might have more baked goods on offer in the display cabinet given the business name, but there were just a few scones and muffins. I opted for the smoked salmon scrambled eggs and was not disappointed."

Paleo? They sure make it easy to follow the lifestyle. Their menu features salads and meats with veggie sides in addition to the typical bakery delights. Good luck avoiding the breads and pasteries...they look delicious! 

So far, I've had the beetroot, pumpkin and feta salad (skip the feta for the Paleo folks), and it was awesome. Very fresh. I've also sampled their omelet with peppers, mushrooms and ham, which was also good. My favorite so far is their peri peri chicken ($22) because it couldn't be more Paleo with seasoned, grilled chicken breasts and veggies. Don't love too much spice? They put most of the sauce on the side. 

In the Killiney Road area and looking for something healthy? This would be my first recommendation. I'd go here daily if it was a bit less expensive!"

This review is based on my pre-COVID experience so I'm unsure what it is like now considering Hawker Centres are so communal. 

When visiting Singapore, I wanted to experience the liveliness of a Hawker Centre and this did not disappoint. There are so many food stands specializing in certain dishes so you know whatever you end up choosing, it will be good. I ordered the duck and one stand and my fiancé ordered Pad Thai at another. Both were good but the Pad Thai was honestly THE BEST Pad Thai I have ever had and still crave it to this day. 

The prices are incredibly cheap and it makes your vacation money stretch. 

Singapore is hot and because Hawker Centres are busy and full of people on their lunch breaks, it gets even warmer. However, there are fans blowing which helps a little. 

If you find an empty seat without tissues on the table, grab that seat! People claim their seats by putting a packet of tissues on the table. It was so amazing to watch this ritual because here in the U.S, not only would someone take that seat, they'd also take the tissues. It was beautiful to see how trustworthy people were with leaving their claimed seats to grab food and how honest the other customers were by not grabbing the claimed seats. 

Overall, this was a wonderful experience and anyone visiting Singapore should come to this specific Hawker Centre. Why this one? Because the Pad Thai is worth the  long flight. Definitely try it!"

A little nondescript, but unmistakably hip decor - newish designer touches mixed in with just enough vintage Singaporean coffee shop furniture to feel homey without being pretentious. A good mix of residents, young and old, make this less of a hip hangout and more of a local coffee spot. 

Ostensibly a re-do of an existing traditional local coffee roaster, this place does a selection of espresso and pourover brews (v60 and kalita), as well as some cold brew. Single origin beans from the usual places - Kenya, Brazil, etc. Had me a Nicaragua pourover - tasted a tad over roasted but still a well executed brew. Prices are very reasonable too - $5.50 for a pourover that would cost me $7 in a hipper joint. $15.50 for a 250g bag of whole beans, compared to $18-$20 elsewhere. 

Some dessert in the fridge - cakes and chocolate, plus what appears to be flavoured sodas. Didn't try 'em but good to know they have some sweets in case you're a bit famished. 

Definitely a decent and cosy venue for a quick cuppa, and a quiet place for a brief respite from the day's exertions. Will be back."

For dinner and during the week, I'm sure it's pumping with work catch ups, dates and small groups working their way through the menu.

We came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was very quiet, just one other table in the venue (also Australians, seems to be popular with expats) and a limited brunch menu. 

On weekends, the menu is limited to brunch tartines (open sandwich) and a couple of specials only. We opted for the lobster tartine - definitely as fancy as it sounds. One big slab of bread covered in delicious lobster and toasted gruyere. We also opted for the special, which was truffled chicken. Also delicious and delicately portioned. 

The food is expensive, but the ingredients are high quality too. I did scoff at the $20+ 'Melbourne tartine' of smashed avocado on toast, but then again they charge about $18 for fancy versions of that at home too. 

The service was very attentive (almost too much given how few people were there) and it was a relaxing and quiet break after a full week of living on hawker centre food."

Knee-deep in my quest for Singapore's best chai latte, I opted for their iced chai latte. It was notably sweeter than the other cups I've tried, but no where near too sweet.

Their signature Guanaja ($7/slice) is a cake that one can never get enough of. The light sponge, punctuated by layers of mousse is sandwiched between a shiny layer of rich dark chocolate ganache on top, and a crispy hazelnut base made of cornflake crumbs below. The flavor is well-balanced; though rich, the cake remains pleasantly light in terms of texture, which leaves one craving more down to the last bite. 

Due to the low human traffic here, they have many promotions worth capitalizing on: 
1. Tea set ($6): one slice of cake and tea/coffee. Top up 50 cents for a latte. 
2. Daily promo: All slices of cakes for $5 (not too sure if this is still available)

In conclusion, though Rive Gauche can be found in many places, this branch has a quiet charm that'll definitely bring me back!"

This fast food joint is known for its iconic breakfast set- - Kaya Toast and Kopi. 

After a quick scan of the menu, we opted for their Kaya Toast set which came with a hot Kopi (subbed for an iced Kopi) and Rendang Chicken. 

KAYA TOAST 
While the Kaya jam itself was decent, the thin overly-toasted breads were dry and unpleasant. Sure, it's made extra crispy to be eaten with the runny egg (which I am not keen on) however, a meal should be pleasing as a combo as well as on its own. Needless to say, this was unpalatable. 

RENDANG CHICKEN
The concept of stuffing this aromatic and spicy chicken into a pocket of toasted bread was genius and a convenient way to eat this dish however, the flavor of the chicken was not tasty. The curry flavor was subpar making this an underwhelming meal. 

KOPI
It leaned more towards a deep bitterness flavor lacking the perfect blend of the sweetened condensed milk. 

While the history of this place is captivating, the food is unimpressive. 

Not a place I'd recommend for a genuine and delicious breakfast spot."

We went for Sunday brunch and between everyone at the table sampled quite a few items on the menu. I had the Ultimate Beef Yard burger and my wife had the Big Breakfast. My burger was slightly undercooked and VERY greasy and the fries (which I had heard good things about) were dry and overcooked. The breakfast items were rather bland as well. Prices (as mentioned in other reviews) are not cheap and frankly very inflated for the quality. 
The place is fun to visit and I suspect that's what you pay for. It is family friendly but very, very noisy for lunch on a Sunday - don't expect any intimate conversation. 
I think this is a low 3 star rating due only to the quirky fun atmosphere but I would not return for the food."

Yes, it has been upgraded since times of old but it has remained a great place to check out a vast mixture of true Singaporean cuisine.

There are two distinct areas of Lau Pa Sat Festival Market. There is the interior where you will find tons of food vendors offering various types and interpretations of food and then there is the outdoor space where you will encounter a lot of food hackers calling you over to their stand.  The interior space does protect you from the elements to a certain degree but the outdoor food stalls are definitely the place to eat at night. 

Overall, this is a great place to check out the various interpretations of true Singaporean cuisine and to truly experience Singaporean culture. One of the great things I find about Lau Pa Sat is that though, sure you are going to encounter a certain number of tourists, it is not overrun by them like say the outdoor dining space of Chinatown.

Overall, fun place to eat."

I had Stella Artois while my friend had Coronas. It was a pretty cool evening so we seated right outside on the pavement next to what is now a walking street, so it's pretty great for people watching.

Had the Chicken Cordon Bleu, surprisingly big portion with 2 sides (I chose mashed potato and pasta salad)  and fairly decent tasting as well. My friend adores the tictactoe fries (waffle fries really) which are pretty crispy.

Decent spot it you're looking for an affordable night out!"

I really love the pudding here. My favourite ones are the milk pudding (which comes with caramel sauce) and coffee pudding (comes with creamer). Not something you can easily find, and it's really smooth and wobbly. I was a little disappointed with the cake though. Tried the special called 'Rose Chiffon', the colour was nice, had a cream cheese frosting, but it tasted a tad too normal. And of course, the slice of chiffon cake cost a tad too much. 

Anyway my friend ate a main course on the second visit and said it was bad. The pork was too dry! I guess I'll still stick to my desserts."

I was a little dismayed that they put lemon in it, as I personally do not like lemon at all, but it was still very good. The sauce was so creamy, and the plating was beautiful, as it was for the other meals. We also had a piece of chocolate cake that was amazing - it was rich, decadent, and moist. I split the cake with a friend, which was definitely a good idea because the food is quite filling here. One of my friends ordered Mr Lich's Flaming Brew, which was an alcoholic drink that they light on fire by sprinkling what I think was cinnamon onto it. It was definitely a cool sight, though I'm not sure how it tasted. I'm not really one to go all out with themes like this, but my friends convinced me to wear the robes they had for each of the houses in Harry Potter, and it ended up being a fun touch. Overall had a great time and would definitely recommend for a weekend brunch spot."

We didn't need to make a reservation on a Friday night so kudos to that. Do check out their Fb page for opening days as certain days may be booked for events or so.

Overall the location of the place is excellent at Bugis+ and they have a smoking area outside as well.

Typically you get tapas bites and 1 for 1 offers, great for big groups and intimate gathering for beers! Had their luncheon meat fries and they were fried beautifully with a serving of nancho cheese chips.

A very kid friendly appearance, but I appreciated the quirkiness nonetheless. Excited by the ambiance, I approached the counter to order my coffee. The woman working was exceptionally rude throughout our entire interaction. I decided to get my order as take away because of her attitude I did not want to linger there any longer. Upon leaving I thanked her and said ""have a nice day"" to which her response was ""yes, okay"" without even looking up at me. I was baffled by how such an adorable place could house such a grumpy woman that acted as if my coffee order was greatly inconveniencing her... and the coffee wasn't even any good!"

Service is extremely friendly and the owners go out of their way to have a conversation about the coffee. Named after the ""optimal temperature"" of coffee (according to??) but I would beg to differ given I prefer my coffee piping hot. Currently have an introductory offer for $2 lattes which is quite the steal despite the smaller cup. From discussion with the owner I have tried their Mexican blend which has more of a chocolatey, berry taste (and is my preferred taste) and then when this sold out, also their other blend (name escapes me) which had a citrusy bright taste. I think they should label their beans so you know which one to request. Double shots are the norm apparently so that gets a thumbs up in my book. They have some baked items, which look like half-sized muffin (somewhere between a mini and a standard sized muffin) and they look pretty unappealing (especially compared to the sweet treats available at the neighbouring Artisan Boulangerie Company) and I would strongly suggest they try and up the ante in the bakery department!
There is also a tapas bar as part of 63 celcius. While I would go back to the coffee shop, I would give the tapas bar a miss and this is what has brought my review down... $18++ for a glass of wine that could barely be considered a ""glass""... even with the free flow tapas from 4-7pm this was a rip off (and  ""flowing"" is not a word I would use to describe the frequency of the tapas being distributed). All in all, give the coffee a try, and hopefully the tapas side lifts it game because it faces pretty stiff competition from Cook & Brew, The Exchange, The Bank, Marche and Extra Virgin Pizza."

You may have been going home after working in the CBD area and thinking to yourself, ""What I would do for a place similar to Grain Traders, or just something else other than the bar food that surrounds the area....well wait no longer true believer because ""Eat Me"" is here to save us all. The cafe is conveniently located in UE square, in the area where the Kopitiam used to be, and boy am I glad that this was the place to take the space over. Eat Me's tag line is ""Lettuce satisfy you"" (hehe) and the they do not disappoint. Once you stop giggling at some of the creative names on the menu (like ""Posh Spice"" and ""Big Miss Steak"" and finally get your food, your palates are treated to plethora of euphoric sensations. Best of all, you finish the food and you are actually full and you also do not get dragged down or feel heavy. Perfect for after working out. 
I've been here twice now and have tried the Daffy Duck and Big Miss steak, I'm definitely coming to try everything.
The place also served breakfast! I have yet to try but they look yummy.
Oh and they have also just started putting cold press juices on the menu. I had the ""coconut, green apple, spinach and cucumber"" juice...and yes it tastes even better than it sounds!

I asked what their most popular milkshake was and they recommended the 80's chocolate shake. It came with a scoop of not very good vanilla ice cream on top (instead of mixed in) with what looked/tasked like Smucker's hard shell chocolate topping on top - not something I would normally eat.

Then the milkshake hurt my teeth because there were big chucks of ice in it. Who puts ice in a milkshake? Especially an $11 milkshake? I feel like this is a case of paying more to get a worse product. I wish I had gone to Ben & Jerry's or Cold Stone."

They labelled themselves as the ""world highest urban craft brewery"" and man, actually the view up here is splendid! Take the inside seats facing outdoors, as it's really not that chill after all staying outdoors in this 365 summer Singapore.

I chanced upon a post by a friend on the Saturday brunch buffet and decided to give it a try for my big boy's birthday. It's a minimalist brunch compared to the hotels buffet we usually come across, which I like about it as the selection is small but great individually! We made reservation through a 3rd party app, and the staff called to confirm my reservation the day before. On Saturday itself, we were held up by some errands on the morning which we called to delay our reservations twice, and the staff responded positively to our request and I'm truly thankful for that!

The selection are very clear in 1 small confined area. Cold selection, hot selection, cheese, soup, desserts. That's all we've got. There's nothing international about the Saturday brunch. Cold selection includes salami, some seafood, salad. Hot selection includes foei gras, mini eggs ben, mini blue cheese quiche tartlets, roast beef, sausages, and 2 more dishes I couldn't recall. Desserts and cheeses are cluttered at one corner. Well, I'll pass the soup next time. Soup served on that day was a tomato relish sort of soup (well it's not labelled), and it tasted super salty which I stopped after 2 mouthfuls. There's also a selection of bread which you can choose to go with it. Apart from the soup, I love how all the rest are served so nicely.

The highlight of the brunch is definitely their craft beers, beer cocktails, and special beer cocktails of the month! It's your a hardcore beer drinker, you can opt to top it up for the ""beer buffet"" version from the normal buffet price of $58++. Alternatively, you can order the beer separately. For a brewery, buffet and beer combination is definitely the way to go!

One of the nays will probably go to the service. Staff do not give you much attention and you just gotta try your best to wave hard, or go up to them. My plates are not cleared promptly, neither was my water filled. I don't know if it's the privacy time which they are trying to give us, or they simply don't care. However, they are not rude la, still can make it.

Finally, the view up here is a true win! We enjoyed the lovely view over brunch, which makes our Saturday slow paced and relaxed. They also live up to their name as a brewery for the tasty draft they served! It was an enjoyable weekend brunch which I'll be back again."

After visiting a couple of other hawker centers, this one was your typical place of various food stalls and such. Do note, that if you need to go to the restroom, it will cost you ten cents to do so.

For most of the food here, the options vary from porridge to pasta to the typical dishes you see at hawker centers. I didn't know what to get so I conducted a small experiment. Instead of ordering whatever looks good to me, I simply chatted with some of the locals and ordered food based on their recommendations. Result? Everything I got was DELICIOUS. One of my favorite items was the Thai style noodle dish with wonton soup. The stall was located in a dark ish looking corner of the place. The wonton soup = yummylicious. The broth was perfectly seasoned and the wontons itself were savory and filling. For only $4, you get both the wonton soup + the noodles. Noodle dish was quite tasty, with the fresh cut BBQ pork and the seasonings on the dish wasn't too overwhelming. For other small dishes I tried, I really enjoyed the curry flavored puff and the fried dumpling. For the puff, the outside was nice and flaky while the inside tasted legitimately like good Thai yellow curry with its potatoes and chicken. As for the fried dumpling, this was surprisingly filling! The inside was mostly chicken, potatoes and small veggies and it had a nice spicy kick to it.

Overall, I really like the vibe of this place. You don't see too many tourists and the locals are friendly and nice to talk to. Not sure if it was the time we went (late afternoon), but there was hardly a long wait (except for one stall in particular) for most of the food stalls. Definitely a relaxing eating experience at this hawker center."

After a bit of research, I narrowed my options down to:

Apiary
Creamier
Lickety

Time for a heads up review.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

All three of these spots have comparable atmospheres, with Creamier coming out on top, Apiary being a great neutral iteration of a contemporary ice cream shop, and Lickety being maybe the weakest of the three just by a smidge in that they don't accept credit cards, which was frustrating. 

Apiary: Star (1)
Creamier: Star (1)
Lickety: Star (1)

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Prices are comparable across the board at each of these shops. Apiary was the priciest at $7.50 for two smallish scoops, Lickety was $4.50 for a single scoop, and Creamier was $3.80 for a single scoop. Good pricing.

Apiary: Star (2)
Creamier: Star (2)
Lickety: Star (2)

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

When it came to flavor and consistency, there was a clear winner here in Creamier, which had a fantastically smooth, creamy, and flavorful Salted Caramel. Lickety and Apiary were both good, but Apiary, the weakest of the three, was over frozen whereas Apiary was good but not great. 

Apiary: Single Star (3)
Creamier: Two Stars (4)
Lickety: Single Star (3)

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

Maybe surprisingly, I wouldn't be excited to come back to any of these ice cream spots, but maybe that's because I'm simply so spoiled by the stacked Los Angeles ice cream scene. 

Apiary: No Star (3)
Creamier: No Star (4)
Lickety: No Star (3)"

I got a chocolate themed drink (don't remember the name) that was a chocolate OVERLOAD. It was chocolate ice cream with gobs of nuetella, chocolate syrup, toasted marshmallow and whipped cream topping. 

It sounds really good, but the chocolate they used tasted so artificial that it ruined the drink for me. I usually don't have high expectations for novelty drinks, but it was really hard to even drink the fake chocolate taste. 

The service was also very, very slow. There was no one in the cafe but we had to wait 20 mins at the cashier for someone to see to us. It seemed like the staff was avoiding us at one point. 

The concept of the store is cool, but I would suggest going for a simpler drink if you want to visit."

great ambiance and atmosphere with clean and well-maintained venue, always appreciated. The place is spacious indoor as well as outdoor. 

Service 5/5 
attentive and helpful service throughout. 

Food 4.5/5
we ordered pork ribs that comes with grilled corn and mashed potato, and it is as good as it can get. You can slice through the meat with just the weight of the knife and it melts in the mouth. The mashed potato is very fresh and goes well with the meat, no additional sauce needed. Can't really comment about the corn aside it being fresh since I don't like corn. 

The next food is prawn risotto which is first class, although I am not a fan of el-dente rice, therefore it is not as enjoyable as it could, but I appreciate the food prep and quality itself. The sauce is perfect, flavorful but not too much, the prawns are fresh and prepped excellently. 

I give an overall score of 4.5/5 because I haven't tried other options that will make me a regular yet, but will try since it is a nice place to hang out and chill while enjoying a good food and wine. A bit pricey but reasonable with the food quality offered."

Somehow the shaved ice and matcha latte here are not as good as those I had at 313 and at 100 AM (also closed down now). I am not sure what is the issue but the taste is not there. 

The place is also quite tiny and the walkway just fits the width of a stroller.  So if you are going to bring your child with stroller, it will be better to sit near the entrance instead of all the way inside.

I am just glad that there is still an outlet in the Orchard Road area."

And although a zoo during the work week when at least 100,000 blue collar workers are looking for lunch all at the same time, I find this place really quite nice during off hours and evenings (on the weekends, some places are closed, thus why mid-week is better). 

Lots of seating, loads of cheap food options for any craving, and on the land of historically the first open air markets like this in Singapore countless years ago, Lau Pa Sat is a little chunk of history amongst the urban jungle growth of Singapore's financial district. 

In addition to the Satay Street experience that is available every night street side (See Yelp ""Boon Tat Street Food Market""), I am addicted to Thunder Tea Rice served from the Thunder Tea Rice stahl at Lau Pa Sat.  A bowl of rice/quinoa, topped with green onions, peanuts, basil and dried anchovies, then you pour over a thick layer of green tea...it sounds awful, but such a healthy, hearty food discovery of mine I love.  A bit salty, unique flavors, fresh.  You can then get it as a set, with tofu and a fried egg all for like $8 SGD.  But from vegan options, to Chinese, Malay, Indian, fresh juices, bakery items, beer....there is a lot to be found here. 

Now a local would say that this is not the best hawker center in Singapore and I would not disagree (Tiong Bahru might be my favorite!). You will always find more authentic options the further out you go from the tourist areas for sure.  But if you are a tourist and looking for your closest option to MBS and the harbor area or you live downtown like me, Lau Pa Sat is your closest option and a relatively decent, clean one at that."

Located walkable distance from Tanjong Pagar MRT and next to famous ramen chains. 

After exploring the menu, I decided to order Prime Beef with Streaky Bacon. Yes, I am a fan of bacons. And Gruyere cheese sounds unfamiliar. For the beverage, I asked one of the staffs whether the ice lemon tea was homemade and when she answered it was, I ordered that.

Price wise here was a bit steep. For the meal, you can either get the wedges for the price listed on the menu or add-on for other side dishes. I decided to try truffle fries with the burger.

For the home made ice lemon tea, it is highly recommended. But unfortunately they placed too much ice cubes inside the glass that lost its taste after 20 or so minutes. Could probably ask them for less ice. 

For the truffle fries, it was good if consumed before 10 minutes. Unfortunately I left them out in the air for long and they turned soggy even though the truffle fries were of thin cuts. 

For the beef patty, I ordered it medium rare as that is what I normally choose for burgers. Sadly it was not as juicy as other Yelpers had mentioned. The bacon was chewy to my liking and the buns were nicely baked. 

Store wise, it is not so spacious and could only contain maximum 15 customers. So to avoid the crowds, you might need to come earlier. Portion was reasonable and it did satisfy my hunger."

While this was my first time having kaya toast, the down-to-earth staff and the other people reflected how this isn't a tourist trap type restaurant. Now about the actual food

Kaya Toast - kaya jam is made from eggs, coconut, and pandan. While eating the kaya toast, the flavor is primarily sweet with a hint of coconut richness and a whiff of floral pandan, but sweetness is really the primary impression here. Also, due to the generous spread of butter/margarine, kaya toast feels a lot heavier than you might expect. I thought that the soft and runny soft boiled eggs would be too much for me but I think the quality of the eggs are better here or they're just perfectly cooked. They didn't have any of that raw eggy aroma that can sometimes make me retch a bit.

Milk Tea - not quite as rich as hong kong milk tea. I think the UHT milk gives it a bit more of a cooked milk flavor which is quite nice. It's not too sweet, has some decent depth of tea flavor."

Ordered a plate of char siew/siew yoke/roast duck. And a small bowl of wontons (4 of them inside). That, with 2 plates of noodles, came up to $19! No idea how they counted.. I guess ordering normal noodle bowls each would've been cheaper. Ah well.

Anyway, roast duck was pretty gd, tender. Char siew was, as others have described, very caramelized (read: sweet) and fatty! My my... It reminded me of satay a little, actually. perhaps because of the caramelization. I don't like fat, but I could see how people would like this.
Siew yoke was crispy, I'm also not a fan because of the fat, and some parts of it were pretty salty. But fairly tender meat, where there was it.

Wontons had the crunch of water chestnut bits in it, pretty gd soup.

Guess I wasn't crazily wowed by it, but it was pretty good. Would like to try their soy sauce chicken next time!"

i think my favorite little nuance is that they allow you to pick a unique sake class whenever you order a sake and will even let you try them before you buy them.

This is probably the most un-hipster place in the area but I LOVE IT because it has so many good stalls for cheap. You could come here everyday for a week and not get sick of it because there's just so much variety (tried and tested)

Heads up that most of the stalls are closed on monday (something to do with the slaughterhouses not being open).

So my favourites so far are the

- Zhong Yu Yuan Wei Wanton noodle for the ARMPIT CHARSIEW!
- Tau Kwa Pop store for the TAU KWA POP!
- Lee Hong Kee Roast for the ROASTED MEAT AND RICE! (chili was exceptionally awesome)
- Hu Ji Fishball Noodles for the FISHBALL NOODLES! (this stall only, there were 3-4 fishball noodle stalls in the area)
-Hwa Yuan Porridge for the FRIED PORK INTESTINES PORRIDGE!

Large, spacious, well-ventilated even in this awful haze and sheltered from the sun and rain. And you could have an entire meal for less than a main at any other place in the area. 5 stars for sure!"

We ordered 2 egg dishes (Sunny Lovin' and Craftsmen Breakfast) and 2 coffees (coconut latte and iced salted caramel latte). 

I asked about the difference between a regular and large sized coffee so I would know if they just pour in more milk for a large or if they add an extra shot of espresso. The answer I got from the barista was confusing as he said it had 4 shots of espresso. Coffees both came out after about 10 minutes and they both tasted great!

The Sunny Lovin' arrived after about 20 minutes. The Craftsmen Breakfast took 30 minutes. By the time the second plate of food arrived, the first meal was already finished being eaten.

Half an hour is too long to wait when all that needs to be cooked is bacon and eggs. Warm up some baked beans and toast, throw on some rocket and dressing and 2 pieces of smoked salmon and that was the rest of the dish.  Combined with the $20 price tag and meals coming out at staggered times; the great coffees just don't make up for the poor service and long wait times. 

The washroom lights are activated by a sensor, however it did not work consistently. As I was in there the light kept turning off and not turning on. Try as I might waving and flailing my arms, I sat there in darkness and went about my business. Even after standing to wash my hands, the lights did not turn on. 

After speaking to one of the staff they checked into it and the sensor is working. So maybe just bad luck for me. 

If you're looking for a good cup of coffee to go then you're in the right place. If you're expecting value for their food and quick service then I would not bother going here. 

Pros:
-great specialty coffees
-free water(?)

Cons:
-long wait time for food
-orders do not arrive at the same time
-slow service
-expensive for what you get (imho)
-washroom light sensor inconsistent
 
Overall: 3/5

This was there first weekend open so I'm sure they had difficulties. They had already run out of some of the items on the menu when we arrived at noon. 

Really hard to think of pros other than the coffee but will return to try brunch again in a few weeks and expecting a far better experience."

I was seated in a comfy corner and menu and order list are all there. 

the menu... simple and easy to understand. well designed and obviously fab. i wanted to approach the counter to order but was immediately attended to promptly and my bff's crispy requirement to her pancakes addressed. i was escorted to the cake/pies/desserts from heaven section (maybe I have that i-need-dessert-now face). all the specials were introduced in detail and I felt at home. like how you will introduce your prized collection to your guest.

our orders of extra crispy pancakes and croque monsieur was well done and served properly. granted they kinda forgot my extra cup of latte ordered but overall they were attentive to detail. me and my friend left the table to decide on the cakes we wanted and when we returned to the table, voila! our water was refilled and my friend's tea was topped up with more hot water! this was without us asking! i am impressed!

While they have a policy on weekends that the turnover per table is 1.5 hours from reservation, we were not rushed out of TFBB. However, I can see why they need the tables. everyone wants a taste and feel of home on a saturday!

the dessert was well done. i had the blueberry yoghurt cake while my friend had the raspberry cake. very well done and not too sweet. goes well with a cup of coffee. one gripe is that their latte art needs a bit more work (not consistent and a little sloppy).

Overall, this is not just another restaurant checked off the list. a very impressive service staff that makes you keep coming back because you feel welcomed and at home. of course the dessert junkie in me is prepping for the next visit to try ALL their cakes. 

TFBB, you live up to your name. continue to always serve fabulous food in a fabulous fashion. you have won me over with ur extensive range of cakes and sweets but most importantly, your hospitality. thank you for starting my saturday right."

We thoroughly enjoyed our Saturday lunch at Open Farm Community.  I have long been a fan of Tippling Club and Open Door Policy and we finally snagged a reservation at Open Farm Community (tip: indoor seating fills up fast!).

While the prices were hefty, when you keep in mind that the ingredients emphasize the freshest and most natural possible, somehow your wallet won't wail quite as loudly...

Food was good, service was extremely attentive and snappy and the ambiance was convivial.

The only thing we might not order again were the clams...after paying 2.50 / 100 grams of clams in decadent squid ink butter at Dancing Crab, it was very difficult to reconcile paying ~20 for a small bowl of clams.

PARTING THOUGHT: We lucked out as our visit coincided with the once a month farmer's market...everything from cocktails by bar stories to small batch gourmet goodies to purveyors of fresh seafood and meats were on feature, adding to the festive atmosphere!"

This store is constantly crowded ever since the PLQ mall opened, and it's hard to find a seat especially on weekends. 

Yes, I know it's a Starbucks, so it's not exactly batch roasted craft coffee. But when you need a consistent caffeine (and/or sugar) hit, Starbucks is fine.

(P.S. It's takeout only now during the circuit breaker, and the reserve bar closes early at 9pm)"

The soup of the day was pumpkin- way too sweet although the texture was nice. 

The main was... a joke. The pasta was barely enough for my 15 year old nephew and parts of the chicken were undercooked. 

On a more positive note, some of my friends who ordered the ala carte said their food was good. 

Avoid their set meals at all costs."

Let me try to be objective though.

Came in on a Sunday for brunch (today, actually)

Had smoked salmon set sans the salmon, because vegetarian. 
Flat white. Long black. 

My friend had the smoked salmon set and vouched for the edibility of the salmon, hot cocoa, and we shared a French toast set. 

Food was great, waiting time was Long, even though the place was not crowded. Worth the wait though. Price is average for cafes. Decent portion size.

Music is old fashioned jazz-ish music. Not loud enough for me, but then again, to each their own. 

Service was great. Attentive, friendly, non-judgy even though my half-asleep brain asked weird questions about the menu. 

Bright enough for study/work/reading. 
They also have a great selection of books to read. 

If you're so inclined, it's a great place to transition from coffee to wine/beer. 

All in all, an experience I wouldn't mind repeating the next time I have an itch to be outside on a Sunday."

Putting aside the question of why so many people can have a sit-down breakfast during normal working hours on a weekday, I am curious about Sarnies' breakfast offerings. I have allowed my curiosity to build up until one morning last week when I found myself particularly free and decided to venture inside Sarnies.

As i pushed the door and stepped in, I seem to have walked from Telok Ayer to England, perhaps some cute little cafe in East London. I could not help notice that the overwhelming majority of the clientele is angmoh and just a second ago, I was surrounded by the laughter of uncles enjoying their kopi at the kopitiam next door so wow! that was a bit unexpected.

The set up is simple, there is a huge counter where you order and get your food and drinks and then a few tables and chairs against the wall and filling up the rest of the limited space.  A lot of people seem to opt for the outdoor seats which is a pretty good spot for people watching on the busy strip of telok ayer.  

Having quickly scanned the menu on the board, I decided to get the salmon cream cheese bagel since I have not had a bagel for a while (actually never in Singapore to be accurate).  I was a bit disappointed that I could not choose the type of bagel. It is definitely not cheap, my bagel came at a cost of almost S$10 and with a flat white that brings the total damage to 14. I mean, to be fair, the bagel is huge and if you are willing to pay 10 for a sandwich in the cbd this is acceptable but still, $14 for breakfast seems a bit on the high side.  I opted to bring my bagel back to the office since the place is too packed.  Delighted to find that they have taken the time to wrap my bagel up in foil so by the time I sat down at my desk and opened the wrapping, it's still nice and warm.  The bagel itself is pretty good, soft and smooth cream cheese that blends well with the salmon and the portion is quite generous.  I really enjoyed it so quality wise I cannot complain. I heard their brunch menu is pretty good so will come back and try."

As for the food wise I ordered the Corn Beef Hash $17, Babi Pong Tay $20 and Roti Babi $14.

Corn Beef Hash the taste is nice and it's cook with the baby potato but I felt it's alittle dry. It would be alittle too much for 1 to consume as it can be alittle overdose.
My friend commented that the Babi Pong Tay is nice and the meat is so soft and tender. Lastly, the Roti Babi is overdose with oil and the topping is alittle dry. When I cut it the oil just ooze out. Oh Gosh, it's so fattening.

As for my brunch today, it's alittle different from usual as it has a the peranakan taste. Maybe it's the food I ordered and I felt it's a little oily for all the food.

Overall experience is good but maybe I have to try other food so I can give another review."

It operates several locations across Singapore, including two in Raffles Place (with the other being located in Market Street). I prefer the Chevron House outlet as it's larger, more inviting and, because it's not out in the open, has more privacy.

 On the coffee front, Dimbulah is certainly very much Australian in that the staff is friendly and its coffees are brilliant. I've only had the flat whites here twice and they've been consistently delicious. Prices are reasonable for Singapore at $4.50. The only let-down though is that there's no latte art. I know it'll vanish the moment I drink my beverage, or, what's more likely, get destroyed by the time I get back to my office, but... still! Presentation does count, and for that, I'll take off half a star, only Qype doesn't do half stars, so I have to take off one whole star so as to distinguish Dimbulah from the other cafes with great coffee.

 For food, Dimbulah offers sandwiches, wraps and cakes. This particular outlets also sells soups from Saybons.

 Given its location, it can get a little crowded with office workers swinging by to get their morning /post-lunch fix, but the service is very fast, without quality being compromised."

I have past by this place a few times and it seems like a normal cafe just the like others, but I was very wrong.

I met 2 other Yelpers at the cafe, we managed to get a place near the window. It was a small cafe so getting this table can be frustrating, depending on the time of the day. 

The boss is friendly and sociable and thanks to him we got to know a bit of history of this little cafe and sample some biscuits. We ordered the raspberry scone and for myself, a glass of cold coffee (cafe's speciality) and it is definitely worth it. Prices is pretty reasonable and I would definitely come back to try the others. 

About the Scone - absolutely delicious. Little bit sweet for my liking but this is certainly one to enjoy for every morning before your day starts. No wonder the duchess of this venue comes here so often! As for the coffee, I think it's worth trying it especially for the first timers. For $4.50, it's definitely value for money. 

Overall, I enjoyed my time there and would certainly recommend you to drop by there to try the scones. There are seats outside the cafe, but if the place is full, just take it away and enjoy it somewhere else. There are a couple of Malls nearby to enjoy the air con and the scone!"

Wagyu onsen bowl$14.90
Looked amazing in the pics and the first bite was heaven. I loved the mix of the sauce/egg/rice. Amazing; might almost pay just for that. However found the beef lacking, it was too chewy and also rubbery. Not sure if it was because it was too raw or that it was just like that. 

Chorizo sausage$6.90
Didn't like this at all. 

Truffle mash $2
Friend liked this but I found it extremely average. 

Creamy spinach $2
I quite liked this. Reminded me a little of panek paneer. Decent to share

Lamb
Friend ordered and said it was good. 

The Mexican store.
Friend tried it and thought it was average. I tried the hummus, it was ok but I wouldn't order next time.

Seafood store
Friend ordered the grilled fish. It took around an hour to arrive! So we pretty much weren't hungry by then and found it average. Sides of Chicken luncheon chips and sweet potato fries were very average too. 

Probably wouldn't go back unless someone really wanted me to"

For starters, I loved most part of the service I got at Paul's. Had a delightful lady and gentleman serving and they looked like the genuinely loved what they're doing which -always- make for a nice touch. I just wished I got their names! 

Paul is constantly loaded with people so be prepared for a bit of a wait, try not to let that dent your mood. Also try not to go with too much of an expectation.

My friend got a breakfast set while I had the crepes. They were nothing to write home to and with the choices you get in SG now, I hardly think just doing the basic works. Also, I hardly feel that way, but the quality of the food made me feel that it was really overpriced.

I was genuinely looking forward to trying the desserts since Paul is famed for their bakes. Am a little disappointed to report that both options I picked - lemon meringue tart and another pastry - were lacklustre. 

Moral of the story - listen to your foodie friends when they tell you not to bother with a place."

On top of all of this, one of the orders was left out- which is another logistically error by not having the server repeat everything.

Finally, the last straw- no remorse from the manager at all, then accusing us of ordering things that we never ordered, with no SORRY for the missed lunch for our co-worker, not even offered to knock off the pathetic 10% they call service.

Dimbulah prides itself on bringing fine Australian coffee from the plantation straight to the consumer, and it shows: the coffee here is simply mindblowing. 
They have a breakfast menu as well as a lunch menu. They also have cakes, tarts and muffins on display. However, it seems that most people were there for the coffee.
My friend had a triple deck roast chicken sandwich and a chicken pie. The chicken sandwich was nothing special, just three slices of wholemeal sandwich bread with roast chicken and the usual garnishing. The chicken pie was not bad. I had a tuna baguette which was also very normal, so food-wise, it's really not impressive. As I've mentioned though, the  coffee was really good. It's not harsh and too acidic, and there is kind of an underlying richness which gives the coffee texture and body. Overall, this is a great place to chill. Recommended!"

Think that cup sizes should be bigger. 5oz was slightly bigger than a vending machines Milo cup so I finished that in like 5mins. Sizes there only come in 3 or 5oz. Compared to Starbucks, 8oz (tall size) this was really tiny. Latte art is good. Service is really good too. They should ask though if you'd like sugar or something while ordering.

We got the butterscotch ale, and though I've never been to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, my friend who has said it tasted JUST like the butterbeer you can find there. It was delicious. 

The food was surprisingly good for a theme cafe. We got the confit chicken with pesto spaghetti and the pesto mayo pork ribs. Both were really well cooked, not too much pesto on either but enough to give you a could flavor. The pork ribs were super tender and the sides that came with it were delicious, very American-style like mashed potatoes and sweet corn. I loved it and that's coming from an American mashed potato addict. 

The witch's brew, although I didn't try it, seems like it's something you can't miss here. I was excited to see another diner get it, and the flaming drink looks exactly like a potion from Harry Potter. If I have one regret it's not trying that!"

Located along Simon Road just off the junction of Simon Road, Upper Serangoon Road, and Tampines Road, opposite Stars of Kovan condominium. There are limited open car park lots (~10 lots) in front of Lola's. Else you'll have to drive further into Simon Road where there are additional open car park lots but you'll have to take a 5 minute walk over. Make sure you'll got valid parking or you might risk getting a parking fine from the parking wardens. 

There are limited seating also at the cafe (~20+) especially due to the covid19 restrictions. There are also 2 outdoor seating (al fresco style) tables (from refurbished/repurposed old Singer sewing tables) which seat 4 people each, you can request for the fans above to be switched off if you find it too strong. There is also a 1 hour dining duration so patrons will have to leave after their 1 hour is up.

It's relatively quiet from opening time at 10am on weekdays but they are busiest in the evenings when there is a queue just to get a seat.

SERVICE 3.5/5
Hard to get service during busy periods. Sometimes also hard to find staff on low peak periods. Could be better. 

FOOD & DRINKS 3.5/5
Can be a hit and miss, depending on what you order. The bangers and mash is good, with a nice snap to the sausages and goes well with the potato mash and sauteed onion gravy. Eggs benedict was so so.

OVERALL 3.5/5
Overall a nice place to drop by during off peak hours/days, unless you like to hang out with the crowd during their busy periods."

Despite it being in the center of a walkway, the shopping center wasn't that packed and it wasn't noisy, so I had a grand time.

It is indeed a special little place planted in the center of Ion Mall, and the airiness and surrounded by top designer shops gives it another posh feel--I never thought I could feel so posh having tea in the mall before. The service was pleasant and I felt like I was transported to some 5-star afternoon tea paradise (despite it being the middle of the night). I loved the huge tea selection, and the waiter made some nice suggestions after I asked for something flowery and light. I got the 1 tea + dessert combination (~20SGD) to share with my friend since we had just completed a delicious dinner earlier.

If I were back in Singapore, I could see this as a great hang-out spot to catch up with friends and drink some fancy tea + have cake at any hour of the day. It is pricey, but it's what do you expect for ""the world's finest, luxury, tea brand."" Indulge, and enjoy!

They also have a small shelf of tea you can purchase that smelled amazing."

Skip dinner and come hungry. Skip lunch that day too if you can. Or go for a long swim before and after the meal. Or in my case, stuff yourself as much as you can while promising that you will start a juice cleanse the following day. 

Back to the experience, we came on a weekday without a reservation but didn't have any problem getting a table. You have to first reserve with the concierge on the lobby level, who will talk to the reception at Rise restaurant for some reasons. They will then give you a card that allows you to enter the pool area because this is located right in the middle Tower 2.

The most wonderful thing about this is of course the view. You can choose to sit inside the adorably decorated restaurant or outside with a view of the harbour and ocean. It was a little dark for us sitting outside but if you reserve you could ask for a table with better lighting.

Now on to the food, I was not blown away by one particular thing but generally the buffet was not too bad. There were around 10+ types of cheeses (mostly French I believe) and countless chocolaty desserts. I wonder if cheese is a new addition because none of the previous reviews mentioned it. Coffee or tea is complimentary but they also have a wine menu. 

Overall a must try experience especially if you have a sweet tooth :)"

No stars for service and price.

Also, I apologise in advance for the epic length review.

The word 'hipster' is overused, really. This is a typical brunch restaurant. I don't see where it's 'hip' or 'ster'.

Food is average. Mushroom soup is not Campbell's. Or at least to my un-hipster taste buds. Buffalo wings were like sweet and sour chicken wings, not spicy. Pasta was meh. The only thing I would come back for are the pizzas, Super thin crust and light. Nice.

Ambience is homely. Lots of wood benches and tin pails for decoration. Seats are tightly packed and walk space is narrow. I might have seen a mason jar or two. /shudder

""Will I come back?"" Yes, for the pizza and for the ""buy 1 get one free"" lunch special. Now the mechanics of this BOGO is dreadfully complicated and very sneaky if the customer is not careful. I will explain this in the next section. This would have been so easy to fix when asked, and would have won a life-long customer. But. hey, which restaurant manager would want to do that?

Service is non-existent. Poor guys are overworked and do not have time for pleasantries. 

Price. Ahhh, the only thing this place has going for it is the 1 for 1 lunch special. When you get seated, you will see from the menu that not all items qualify for this. Items that do, have a little label next to it.

So! Imagine the following scenario:

Ah Beng and Ah Lian decide to try this new 'simi-lai eh hipster' cafe near Ah Mah's flat in Tiong Bahru.

They order two muchroom soups ($11 for 2) This items is automatically 1 for 1. Don't know why they have to make life so confusing.

Then Ah Beng orders a Vogole pasta MAIN for $18. Ah Lian orders a Funghi Pizza for $18.

For appetisers, Ah Beng orders Buffalo Wings ($16) and Ah Lian orders Calamari Rings ($16).

So, quick recap: 2 soups, 2 mains, 2 appetisers.

QUESTION: How much was Ah Beng and Ah Lian charged for their lunch? (Assume no service charge.)

ANSWER: You would think, this is easy! 
1 for 1 mushroom soup + 1 for 1 MAIN + 1 for 1 appetiser = $11 + $18 + $16 = $45

Wrong. Because Chapter 55 is so scared that customers will 'take advantage' of the 1 for 1 deal, this is how they calculated the bill:

Mushroom soup is $11 for 2. (Written in the menu, don't argue.)
Higher cost items are charged, lower cost items are free. (Written in the fine print, don't argue.)

Actual bill is: $11 + $18 + $18 = $47

Ah Beng and Ah Lian pays up and leaves, vowing to never come back and also something about mothers and fathers.

Ok, ok, the story is a little dramatic for a difference of $2. But it is the principle of the whole thing. Even if it is not for principle, then it is about making a quick decision to make Ah Lian and Ah Beng happy customers. 

Long story short: After the trauma of mathematics and Chapter 55. Ah Beng and Ah Lian grew closer and lived happily ever after,"

If I don't feel like a sandwich (but I always do--it's the onions that do it), there are also more hearty options from the deli, such as risotto-stuffed chicken, that you can ask them to heat up while you pick your Tekoe tea. And for afters, go to the chiller to pick out some cake (they have one that is essentially a Snickers bar writ large--you may think 2 people can handle it; I suggest you share with more. in any case, more friends in the office is a good thing, is it not?) or pastry for afters. They also have thin-crust pizzas with a variety of toppings, as well as salads, for those of us who absolutely need something green in every meal.

The best part about Tom's are the inventive, delicious flavors. It may be easy to dump thimbles of yuzu syrup into the ice cream machine but it's difficult to produce ice cream of the right sweetness and texture. Flavors include grannys favorite, salted caramel cheesecake, berries and split, pi pa gao, and of course usuals like chocolate, strawberry. 

I highly recommend the yuzu flavor!! It's sweet, light and refreshing. We also tried a mix of chocolate and grannys favorite (a mix of chocolate, malt, marshmallows, i think?), and spent awhile chilling in the spacious interior. There're many tables and it reminds me of those student haunts at Upper Thomson. (also, ah loy thai right opposite is SUPERB- another excuse to visit Toms!)

I wish there were more independent creameries/ice cream shops like Toms, Daily Scoop, Creamier... I've gotta play my part in supporting and frequenting them ;)"

TBC could be a 5-star hipstar hangout. It's got the trendy hipster location; it's got the style, swagger and streetcred. It's got the Singapore shophouse meets grandma's basement chillstar vibe.

Instead it wallows in the 2-to-2-and-a-halfy range with lackadaisical lacklustreness.

The service is the friendless math-olympics nerd who spent the weekend indoors doing times tables instead of outdoors chilling with chums.

The food is the cowardly four-eyed flusher you bullied in first grade using their spiked hair liked a scrubbing brush in the lads lavatory.

The brews are the too-cool-for-school kid who is trying too hard to be liked by everyone, and only marginally succeeding.

The views are the pretty princess that makes attending class worth the while, and worth your smile.

TBC coulda stood for The Best Club; Ten Beer ChillSpot; or To Be Continued (as in let's keep coming back). But instead it evokes Too Bland Chili; This Big Chode; or Tad Boring Chad.

Huey got it wrong. Take it from me. TBC is a square, despite the hip!"

Well. I was wrong. 

Located on the second level inside a REALLY Cool bar, Dapper Coffee put me in a daze: a dimly lit space with a beautiful bronze bar and few seatings by the window. 

At first, I was like ""hmm, is it wrong to drink at noon? I barely had lunch. To appease my inner Debbie Downer , I ordered a banana walnut muffin to cover the fruit and healthy fats group... Yay lunch! 

Since we're at a bar, I had to get an ""Espresso + Tonic"" -- an easy drink on a hot day. (When does Singapore ever had a cold day?!) and you know what? That's exactly what it is. The caffeine buzz after was exceptional, especially since I usually don't get espressos. 

I hung around for awhile so I was able to try their Campari Spritz as well. Served in an extra large wine goblet, this bevvy was bitter and refreshing to my taste. I highly miss good, low ABV cocktails and given the high prices of cocktails in Singapore, I wouldn't necessarily spend $$ on low ABV drinks! :p  so this was an exception. 

My first time here blew me away that whenever I get recommendations for a chill mid-afternoon hangout, Dapper Coffee is the first thing that comes to mind."

My first visit, I opted for a flat white in the bigger cup (forgot what the size is called), felt it was too thin, like I was drinking milk instead of coffee. Subsequently opted for the smaller cup and the mix was just nice.

Highly recommend you come here for any bagel craving you have as you really won't find any better on the island.

The location is pretty cool, all outdoor or bar like seating.

Oh crap, that means the whole damn country is going to populate this place. True enough, the entire blogosphere started talking about the long queues and all that. 

And I thought ""Meh... I already tried Laduree's in London anyway..."" 

Then the boyfriend showed up one night after my dance class with a bag of macaroons. 

I squealed with joy, then I wondered what the hell he did that he felt he had to surprise me with a bag of macaroons. But that's besides the point, I got a bag of macaroons!

Four. To be exact. 

I ate the gold chocolate one first. Seriously, at $7 a piece.. it's like... just chocolate with gold dust. That's it. 

The salted caramel was how I remembered it when I ate it in the sweltering London Summer heat. So was the other chocolate one and the lemon one. 

I have tried Pierre Hermes's macaroons lovingly flown in from Paris by my stewardess bestie.. but it shrunk due to the air pressure, so I couldn't judge if it's the best in the world.. yet... 

So until I fulfill my dream of eating BOTH Pierre Hermes's and Laduree's macaroons both at the same time...... I'll say Laduree's macaroons will be the best 'authentic' Parisian macaroon in Singapore for now."

Decided to give it a try and wow.

Let's start with the aesthetics - small cozy place with cute round tables scattered about. Love the ""themed"" furniture with the pipe details. I'm so over that array of mismatched furniture thing that seems to be all the rage. It's sloppy! There are little owl/rabbit knick knacks around the cafe that I find adorable. Again, that running theme which just shows careful thought. 

We shared a snowflake waffle with ice cream. Yum. Yknow how it is with ""the basics"". Anyone can make cakes, pancakes, toast etc. But the true test is to have it sans any ""taste boosters"". The waffle by itself is already tasty. Drizzled sparsely with icing sugar and syrup (overkill with the sweetness and it'd have been MEH) and the ice cream... Mm. Also appreciate how the waffles are a little on the crisp side, just the way I like them.

I'd say the star is the waffles, but hey, the coffee is pretty good too! The flat white would've been one of the better ones we've had if they were a liiiiiittle less generous with the milk."

We picked Bob's because he wanted live music, and I wasn't too sure about where to get live music in Singapore. Another plus was that it was outdoors.The Havana Night event only happens on Fridays, and it's still happening. We went last October, during the haze season, and lucked out because not many people wanted to be outdoors even though the weather was fine the day of. When you're at Bob's, you really want to be outdoors where the daybeds are. It was night, so we couldn't see much. But the sea breeze was really nice. There were no peacocks the night we went, and I think it's more sanitary that way.

While Bob's is mainly a bar, they serve food too. For Havana Night, they hire a chef to BBQ outdoors, so you smell your food as it is being prepared. We ordered a couple of the Havana Night platter for two, and it served everything on the BBQ menu. My dad particularly liked the lamb. The shrimp with mango salsa was really good too. We also ordered appetizers from the menu -- I particularly liked the pizza. I don't recommend their dessert though.

For drinks, we ordered and shared a selection of cocktails. If you're uncertain, they have a set of 3 glasses of any cocktail as a sampler. Some of the cocktails incorporate Singaporean flavors, like gula melaka. For the more traditional, you can just order a shot of whisky.

As for the live music, it was a trio of men, a singer with guitar, keyboards and drums. They sing in Spanish, and it was a mix of classic and contemporary songs. Definitely crowd pleasers. If you're into Latin dancing, they will play requests too, and the singer is happy to teach the basic steps. There is plenty of dancing space.

Now being situated in the Capella hotel, home to $1000-a-night rooms, you may be a little daunted by the idea of coming to Bob's. For our party of 7, we ended up spending about $400, which was decent. We had a drink each, but we didn't drink excessively.

Bob's is a little hard to reach, so you're going to have to cab in and out. But the whole experience was magical, kind of like being transported to a whole new world. My dad had a lot of fun, and he can't wait to go back again. Yes, it's surprisingly family friendly (we're all grown ups, but a couple of older people won't stand out, unlike at some other hipper joints.)"

Sets are mostly $4.70 and come with 2 soft boiled eggs and a drink. Mains include kaya toast (4 square pieces), French toast, soft bun or egg baguette.

I've tried them all and they are worth the price. The kaya here is thick and I do ask for a little extra for my French toast sometimes.

You get a bigger cup of tea when it's takeaway but often less thick.

The eggs are always nicely done but.. They often take very long to be served!

Staff are pleasant."

Located right across the historic Thiam Hock Keng temple, along a cram street... you should be able to spot it.

Perhaps this place is just too new as it just opened for service mid last month; hence word of mouth is still not spread around much. It was lunch time and the place was still quite vacant. Only two tables were occupied; one was the owners and probably their acquaintances. Regretted being so paranoid of taking the trouble of reserving a table. It was only about 1pm++ did we notice more and more people coming in, but there were still a lot of tables available.

We were a group of 4 colleagues, lunching out together. Most of the food ordered were shared, just so we could have a bite of everything purchased. Opinions shared amongst us obviously varied. And oh! Do note that not all the photos posted here were taken by me. Haha! We shared our snaps. *giggles*

We got ourselves 'Nacho Lover', 'Fried Mushroom', 'Crispy Wings' and 'Signature Prawn & Crayfish Pasta'. For drinks and desserts, we ordered 'Mango Creme Brulee', 'Affogato', 'Iced Lemon Tea' and... 'Halal Champagne'. Yes, you read right. 'Halal Champagne': non-alcoholic. They even have 'Halal Red Wine'. Two of us have never touched alcohol before, so we asked one who had and she confirmed that the taste was exactly the same as a genuine champagne. It tasted like an extreme Apple Zapple to me. *shrugs* 

Nachos were served with 3 different dips: cheese sauce, salsa and guacamole. Okay! Not too overpowering. Fried truffle mushrooms were a bit too soft to our liking. Then again, I dislike mushrooms. The pasta was nice but those chicken wings... Wow! Loved them! We didn't share the Affogato though. But my colleague who got it did say it was good. 

Coming to the creme brulee though, I've tasted Chempedak and even Durian flavoured ones before, but this was the first time I had a Mango flavoured creme brulee. I absolutely loved it. My colleague however found it too sweet... Oh well! I have a sweet tooth. Hence the reason why I guess my Iced Lemon Tea was a bit too bland.

Oh! Getting here is best via public transport. We took a cab here. Parking is almost impossible in this area. Most did illegal parking. Even then, there were no more spots."

Overall, I would give the food two stars and the space four stars, which averages to a three star review. Fortunately, OMB's branding and design is quite impressive.

I would recommend their soups and desserts. It not only tastes good, it looks good too! I love how they will spend time and effort in plating their food before serving it to you. 

A good place to try out if you haven't."

The food
The nam ban bao is the standout here.  A perfectly fried piece of tender chicken is nestled between the fluffy bao for a few perfect bites.  The salted egg yolk shrimp had a nice crunch, but could have used a little more seasoning.  The pork belly brings me back to traditional braised pork belly I loved as a kid.  It's served au jus style with a side of stock!  The truffle fries were wonderfully salty here too.

Ordered their wagyu beef sliders, Serrano ham & arugula focaccia and truffle fries. All were labeled 'bites' And they were all pretty good. The one part of this meal I can't figure out is what type of dining establishment abc wants to be. The decor needs to look like a cafe /bakery during the day and an evening hangout afterwards. Neither is achieved. I get a bakery out front, wine cooler but not fully stocked, craft beers, also not extensive, coffee grinder and espresso at the counter area. Most places that attempt so much fail miserably. Here we get a 'high' pass. Their saving grace is their baked goods. The breads are very well done. And a lovely way to build goodwill with end of day complimentary eclairs. 

I will come back as the food is decent but price points are a tad higher than I would like. Now they just have to laser focus on what they want to be serving and more patrons will make this a regular place."

- We all knew good food coming before it reaches our table. All thanks to the fragrance from the truffle oil. Portobello fritters were so crispy, drizzled with truffle oil on the outside and best of all, it wasn't soaked with oil when we bite our way through it!! So good I think I could have a few servings on my own.

[2] Sambal Sotong $16.90

- These 2 sea creatures were presented to us in a nice char. ""Almost"" grilled to perfection but I thought cooking time could be a little shorter to keep the tenderness of the flesh. The flesh itself tasted slight garlicky and goes really well together with the sambal chilli.

[3] Salted Egg Yolk Calamari $13.90

- Salted Egg Yolk food items wasn't new to any one of us here, it has been trending for more than a year already. What made LHOD's dish stood out? Their version of salted egg yolk sauce was thick, grainy with salted egg bits and not salty. The proportions of salted egg, curry leaves and chilli were perfect where each individual ingredients did not overshine each other. Great on these breaded calamari! LHOD could consider using this sauce to create new dishes too.

[4] Prawn Paste Chicken Wings (4pcs) $15.90

- Look at these wings!! Chicken wings were huge and juicy within. Skin deep fried till super crispy, lightly marinated with prawn paste and a dash of herbs. A pity the marinade did not penetrate into the meat completely otherwise they would have tasted even better.

[5] Drinks:
[a] Iced Chocolate $7.90
- My kind of drink but it wasn't chocolatey enough for me. I preferred thicker sinful ones.

[b] Green Garden Fruit Fizzies $8.90
[c] Pink Passion Fruit Fizzies $8.90
[d] Lavender Blue Fruit Fizzies $8.90
[e] Sunny Day Fruit Fizzies $8.90

- These non-alcoholic thirst quenchers were more interesting. Pretty colors and interesting flavours made us couldnt make up our mind which to try first. We ordered the 4 most popular ones to try out. My favorite was the Pink Passion Fruit Fizzies. I love slight sourish drinks as it gave me more appetite to eat more!

Mains:
[6] Big Breakfast $16.90

- For this price we paying, portion served was really generous. Scrambled egg was done pretty well, just the way I love my eggs to be. The spinach and mushrooms were a little salty but they definitely complement the bread well. Served all day!

[7] Seabass wif Salad $34.90

- Fish meat was firm and succulent. Pretty to my eyes and tasty on my palate. The chef made the pan-fried potato balls looked like scallops, Genius! My 2nd most loved mains for the night.

[8] Pork Ribs wif Salad $32.90

- Whenever I order pork ribs, I'm most concerned with the tenderness of the meat and the sweetness level of the marinates. Lucky this plate didn't disappoint me. The marinates wasn't overly sweet and carried off a smokey aftertaste. The meat fell off bones easily, tender and nice.

[9] Spaghetti Laksa Prawns $26.90

- Tadahhhh.. My vote goes to this spaghetti laksa prawns for best dish tonight. Look at the huge prawns we were given! Very fresh and crunchy. The spaghetti texture was al dente and every mouthful you could taste the spiciness of the sauce. I love the fiery kick from the laksa sauce, but I could take something spicier. If only the sourish from the tomato base could reduce, I believe the laksa taste would outstand more. Nevertheless, this was still my top choice :)

[10] Chilli Crab Bun $19.90

- Who don't love crabs? Everyone on this table loved them! Chunks and chunks of generous crabmeat were made into patties and served to us in a delicious bun made in-house. Look at the Chilli crab drizzle, so generous and everything overflows! We almost licked up the plate *haha*

[11] Pulled Pork Sandwich $17.90

- If we compared this pulled pork sandwich with the chilli crab bun, the former crabby was so much better. Pulled pork was too dry and tough for my liking. Overall lacked the juiciness of meat which I found it a pity. 

Desserts:
[12] Sticky Date Pudding wif Vanilla Ice Cream $13.90

- Sticky date pudding was so good, we wiped it out in seconds. Every mouthful you can taste the fragrance of dates. Beware: It could get very sweet if you pair with the bananas given but we gals dun care! Whack!!

[13] Creme Brulee $10.90

- Tofu-liked vanilla custard base was smooth and slippery, eventually disappeared after touching our tongues. The torched sugar crust gave it more flavour. I would say it's a common item which can do with or without.

[14] Vanilla Bloom Pot $6.90
[15] Pandan Rose Bloom Pot $6.90
- These mini pots piped so beautifully with flower petals attracted us at first sight! Almost too pretty to eat them. Vanilla bloom pot tasted less sweet with a very nice milky flavour and fluffy sponge cake below. As for Pandan Rose, the frosting was too sweet although it smells good. But I couldn't finish the first mouthful. The Pandan cake below was slightly dense too. This flavour definitely for the sweet toothies only."

Despite the cafe being rather crowded even on a weekday afternoon, the waiting time for the coffee was a short five minutes. Service was good. While some benches and tables are available outside the cafe, seating inside is limited.

Their coffee was pretty nice, and I decided not to get their famous 'unicorn tears' or 'Merlion's blood', both of which APPARENTLY are basically nicely presented lemonade and ribena respectively, but I'll have a taste myself next time I drop by. In any case, it's not a very big space, with a bit of a narrow walkway between the bar and the rest of the seating (sat at the bar). I really liked my cake though, because even though salted egg has been done to death, the chiffon cake was very soft and melded well with the salted egg sauce, making for a light but satisfying snack.

I loved how they were playing Andrea Bocelli the entire time!

We ordered macaroons and champagne! The macaroons were sensational!

Also!

The patterned layers of Mont Blanc set it apart from the usual ""noodle strand"" chestnut cakes, with a meringue heart that gave a good measure of crunch. 

The Creme de marron was full of chestnut goodness but the Creme Chantily was in short supply and I wished it could be significantly less sweet. 

Fortunately, it's another chestnut sweet, the Okada Roll ($8), was rational on sugar. The core was pumped up with light chestnut cream and one could inhale whiffs of eggy aroma in the pillowy sponge. 

The Matcha Cake is a simple construction of green tea mousse, azuki beans and sponge. Nothing much fanciful."

Ordered the pancakes during a not so busy time of 4pm and they were pretty obviously microwaved and not freshly made. How do I know? Arrived almost instantly, with steam blazing hot coming out of the pancakes and a horrible texture that can only be achieved with microwaved-old-food. 

Tasted pretty horrible and the garnish of half a sliced banana was just sad. Was served with what tasted like cheap syrup rather than a maple sauce or anything remotely nice. 

Had the rosti as well. Did not add salt at all and the ""poached"" eggs were kinda hard boiled. Nothing was seasoned properly. Kinda disappointing because this was in my memory a great place to eat at. 

Prices are still high. Ordering system was good and efficient but poorly planned on some tables. The iPad was placed in the middle of 2 diners eating which to me was pretty poor thinking. The floor around me was wet and had food all around telling me that the servers were pretty oblivious to things going on around the restaurant. 

Pretty sure this does not happen that often here but this particular experience was exceptionally poor. For their prices & the amount of people that were there while I was there at 4pm, they really should have some sort of consistency towards their cooking with a full team of chefs in the kitchen."

And yet my attempts to put on weight and keep it on have been futile. I think I have worms in my tummy. 

A little birdie raved about this place to me. She went on and on about their breads, especially the Épi de Blé, Orange Cream Tart and Almond Croissant. She adviced me to go early - regulars just come and swipe the items off their shelves! So earlier this week, I hurried to this bakery before noon on Tuesday to get my breakfast before reporting for my afternoon shift in town.

Hungry, I bought whatever my buddy recommended.  I was surprised to discover that the base of the Orange Cream Tart is not the crusty kind but is actually soft bread. I found it a little too sweet though. The Almond Croissant and Épi de Blé were winners! The latter may appear alien, but it makes eating bread less messy - you won't grumble about crumbs falling on your clothes anymore! 

The bakery is too far for me to visit more often though. I don't go to Joo Chiat that frequently, so I'll just try out other offerings at the cafes they supply."

And sure enough, the crowd was thick. The problem with a popular place on a Sunday morning is getting seats and I believe they do not do reservations. So the troop of us, about 6 managed to squeeze ourselves on to a single small table in an odd corner of the place. 

The menu is a replicate of the one found in the other branch at Queen St. Nonetheless, the space and ambience fortunately makes up for the lack of a waiting staff. I would imagine that need to hire a lot more if they were to get people seated by waiters, the dining space is sprawling, indoors and out. 

The food, I had the works. And a beer on the side. Yes, Sunday morning beers. Heh. We had to line up at a counter to place our orders and pay for them at the same time. They advised that the food would be served in 30 minutes or less but in actual fact they came in about 10. Very fast and efficient I thought! The food was as expected, good. 

All in, a rather enjoyable Sunday morning for all us."

Chocolate rainbow cake', 'width': 180, 'height': 180, 'caption': 'Chocolate rainbow cake'}]",Nora S.,en,"We went to NOM for brunch on a Saturday. It wasn't too crowded, there was just another family there with us. My first impression of the place was that it was bare and clinical, with the stark white walls, cement floor and white tables and chairs. It felt.. cold. The mandopop music played through the speakers made me feel even more like an outsider.

I would say the food was average. We had the atlanta eggs benedict, blackstone eggs benedict, truffle fries and chocolate rainbow cake. 

Let's start with the best part- the cake. We got it only because it's supposedly the thing you must try if you're there. I've never been a fan of rainbow cake because they don't really taste like rainbows (cheat my feelings, you know?), but I'm glad I tried this one. The sponge was moist, fluffy and full of flavour, even without the chocolate icing. The icing was decadent - rich, creamy chocolatey goodness that melts in your mouth (and in your hands, I checked). 

The truffle fries were amazing as fries, not so much as truffle fries. They were actually cut potatoes and I believe they were air-fried or baked, so they were not greasy. The fries were crispy on the surface and hot on the inside. Unfortunately, we could barely taste the truffles. In terms of taste, the shaved parmesan on top had more impact.

The poached eggs were not that great, to be honest. They were almost cold by the time they were served, and one out the 4 was not runny in the middle. Toasting the english muffins and grilling the tomatoes would have improved the dishes, i think.

In summary, as NOM is quite out of the way for those who don't live in Macpherson, I think I'd need a stronger reason to go back. The cakes are definitely tempting, so i'd stop by for those if i'm nearby."

They use sugarcane straws which are of awful quality. I took one out and it had already broken. The second broke after a short while too so I just drank directly from the cup.

Their garlic mushrooms and eggs were literally just assorted mushrooms and eggs; Would not recommend you order that. 

Service was pretty much dismal; one of the hostesses basically waved us off and let her colleague (who was super nice) sit us. 
The cashier buzzed us to indicated that our drinks were ready for collection, but he tried to give us the wrong one. (The layout doesn't make it easy to move around so I was a bit ticked when that happened because I knew I had to come back again)

Other than that, if you're into IG, this is the cafe for you! Because aesthetics wise, it was very pretty"

There's no waiting area. It was a Sunday afternoon and seats are all taken. So my group of 4 awkwardly waited at the space near the entrance. 

When we finally got a table, it was by the window. It wouldn't be so bad if the sun didn't shine through and heating up our area. On the bright side, my friend(nearest to the window)'s coffee remained warm throughout.

I ordered scrambled eggs on toasted brioche, $10, with Harrisa sausage, +$4.50. The eggs were tad overdone to my liking instead of runny and creamy. For a moment, I thought I was at McD for Big Breakfast. Very plain and ordinary.

Not going back anytime soon since its just another cafe serving plain pricey eggs. But hey, at least they have free wifi. ;)"

Somehow it feels genuine and laid-back, which can hardly be said for nearby establishments like Forty Hands and Open Door Policy, both of which have amassed loyal cult followings (quite deservedly) and lost their chill factor in the process. Well I suppose crowds are a good thing for cafes to have, though it would be nice to be able to have a meal without feeling like I'm in someone else's way all the time.

These crowds were absent from Flock when we visited one Saturday afternoon for tea. Bit of a welcome change from having to wait in the sweltering heat for a table. It wasn't that the eatery was devoid of people - there was a steady trickle of customers, and the staff looked hard at work.

Portobello, mozzarella & rocket sandwich, $13.50 - Since this was supposed to be tea we ordered one of their sandwiches to share. T'was a pricey sandwich, but I liked that the juicy portobello shroom was so big it occupied the entire pocket of ciabatta. This was quite delicious and would have made a substantial lunch for one, though y'know, the pig in me wishes they had fries on the side.

They have other interesting offerings on their sandwich list like prawn and avocado, as well as pork cheek and gruyere.

Orange bundt cake, $5.00 - Having had a disappointing encounter with a bundt cake the week before, we decided to give the orange bundt cake here a shot. I thought it had a nice citrusy fragrance and crumbled quite satisfactorily, but the others found it to be a little too dry.

Mocha, $6.00 - Flock sources its beans from the ever-reliable Liberty Coffee, which pretty much ensures quality coffee brews. The mocha we had was frothy, chocolatey and every sip was laced with a pleasant hint of bitterness.

In line with their philosophy of providing a ""deliberately relaxed"" ambiance conducive for weekend catch up sessions between friends, Flock was modestly, yet comfortably furnished and I loved the warm lighting. The food here is above average, and it's a lovely place to spend a lazy day, as all my weekends tend to be. Wouldn't mind coming back at all."

But what I love about the tah halia from Rafee's Corner is the generous amount of ginger they put inside the tea - making the tea tangy and soothing at the same time.

Back to reality, I had a  mixed berries mojito which was honestly terrible. The ice was not crushed nor blended properly leaving behind mini ice cubes.

The cappuccinos are excellent as is the brew. I can't remember which beans I chose but the flavours were bright and robust. Payment is on a tip basis, it's so refreshing to see businesses place trust in their customers and not purely for profit. 

The owner was present at the store and you could see his passion just bubbling over. He was regaling the customers with tales of his experiences purchasing beans and being in the coffee business.

For drinks, I ordered the cold drip iced coffee and an elderflower soda. 

It's rather a sticker shock to eat in cafes and restaurants in Singapore. Mostly the price of ""artisanal"" coffee is ridiculous. But I understand that Singapore's rent is ridiculously unaffordable so guests have to pay a premium to come to bricks and mortar cafes, bars, restaurants. 

My cold drip coffee which was served in a tiny glass with ice was $6.  
I was suffering from major jetlag and needed extra caffeine so this obviously made me incredibly sad. 

The food made up for it. My friend ordered a curry chicken and truffle fries to share. I tried a bit of her chicken and it was good. Not too spicy. I can't stand when curries burn a hole in your mouth. (Insert fake Asian joke here!) it was creamy and hearty but lacking in a depth of lemongrass, galangal, and tamarind. The truffle fries were salty, just enough Parmesan for umami, and addicting! 

My dish was better though. 

The dish came out looking HUGE! I gave some to my friend. The fluffy eggs were cooked beautifully and the croissant was buttery, flaky, and soft! My only complaint would be the bacon but that's a personal preference (which many people share) of having super crispy bacon. I like my bacon crispy and these were just mediocre. 

Would I come back here? Sure but I'll try something else."

The flat white in particular is executed skillfully, with a roast that isn't too acidic, topped off with smooth, creamy microfoam.

The wife enjoyed the sweet pepper vegetarian sandwich while my toddler who's been having a bad week cheerily gobbled down the classic scrambled eggs on toast (rye bread).

The butterscotch & berries pancakes were soft and fluffy (get this!), and we couldn't get enough of the banana coconut bread pudding with gula melaka caramel and vanilla ice cream (get this too!)

Give the cookies a miss though - they were dry (we prefer soft and gooey) and were a tad too sweet."

A small tip to venture in quickly before noon to avoid the typical lunch crowd and long lines- after 1pm and chances of anything being left or catering to your palette was slim. 

Nothing prepared fresh at the time- everything is prepacked in styrofoam or plastic containers. My go to was the fried rice with chicken. They also have noodle options that were a little on the bland/hard side, but the rice was always a safe bet. The iced coffee is also delicious.

Again, nothing to write home about, this was always a last minute resort kind of place for me, but on the plus side it's relatively inexpensive."

Love this healthy and authentic Scandinavian eatery in Raffles Place! Wish I had tried this place sooner when I worked at the area.

I tried the smoked salmon sandwich and immediately regretted that I only ordered one, and the thick and hearty avocado soup was one of the best I've tried.  

They have combo lunches such as meatballs and chicken that come with pasta, broccoli, and roasted cauliflower, and salads that are simple yet unique in taste.

I'm just so glad that some of my favourite stall are not pushed aside after the renovation. 

If you're coming here, I'd recommend you to try out the following 

- Beef noodle. It's quite obvious there as it is the only one, just walk towards the ban chang kueh stall deep inside the hawker centre

- Ban chang kueh beside beef noodle. It's really good and they are still doing it old-fashioned style which I personally prefer over Mr Bean's

- Nonya cake shop, located beside the kway chap stall. Near to beef noodle shop, try to spot the bright white neon sign. 

- Tiong Bahru Pau. You would spot this easily as they're the only store to occupy two stalls at the left of the escalator. Queue early in the morning as they're usually sold out by 11 am. 

- Prawn Noodle. It's located somewhat near the toilet, you'd definitely spot it since it has a long queue

- Oyster Omelette beside the famous pork rice. The stall is manned by a very nice and chatty uncle. Although I couldn't really speak chinese, he still tries to relate to me, something I don't really experience in Singapore anymore. The food itself is really good too! Large, fresh oyster was used and the sambal was very fragrant. 

- Char Kway Teow. This is the legendary stall, located to on the left when you come up from the escalator. Try to spot the orange store sign and long queue and voila you arrive at the correct stall. While it is very oily (by very I really do mean it), it has that wok hei that no food court has managed to replicate. It is truly a definitive mark of an experienced cook. 

I'm pretty sure there are many others stall that are just as good but I may not spot it yet. The above are just a snippet of my suggestion if you're crunched for time yet want to experience Tiong Bahru Market."

After admiring their sleek new shop at the Jewel, my cousin surprised me with a durian swiss roll during my stay in Singapore...and it was incredible.  Fresh durian with lots of flavor, the fluffiest cake, and plenty of whipped cream.  Since then, I've been to their old school (original) Kompong Glam shop twice to buy a number more rolls for family and gifts for others.  I've still only tasted durian since I'm durian obsessed but have heard very good things about kaya as well.

Alas it does not make up for eye watering prices and practices such as not offering ice water (instead, you have to pay for your water) and a 2 hour then return the table policy.

Portion size was small, which was expected, but the food was average, which was unexpected given the popularity and look of the place. The avocado chunks were literally black in half the cases - not just lightly oxidised but thoroughly black throughout - no self respecting chef would have served that. The hummus lacked salt. The $10 grapefruit juice they call a ""no-tail"" was not really worth it. The cocktails looked better. We walked on to Common Man to top up the calories despite spending over $100++, rather than try the desserts.

I recognised a few people from the hip crowd (including a Vogue cover). For some reason this place is ""cool"" right now, perhaps the great interior which beats the usual drab school chairs and tables with raw concrete, perhaps the fans which make the heat bearable, perhaps the lack of options nearby. Tables are very close together and the one next to us was quite interested in our conversation."

  :: a local business!
  :: service is you get seated, then you order food from the counter. when it's ready they deliver it to you at your table. very straightforward!
  :: delicious, healthy fare. go for brunch! i had the eggs with mushrooms and bacon, and it was so yummy
  :: they also serve coffee, tea, and pastries
  :: they take credit cards

The Bad:
  :: can get really really crowded during peak times
  :: not ideal for large groups. small groups are fine, but if you want to come here with a group larger than 2-4 people, you are going to struggle to find a place for you all

The Ugly:
  :: none

Would I go back? For certain! This place is a really great, charming, casual dining experience that makes me feel like I'm back in the States.

My favourite cupcake flavour has got to be the strawberry burst as it has fresh strawberries and it is topped with strawberry cream cheese frosting! Simply divine. Price wise it was quite reasonable as well. A good option for parties or gatherings as it brings people closer when you talk about the flavours and textures of the cake.

Overall a good place to have your cupcakes and one of the few cupcake stores in Singapore that actually sell nice cupcakes with so many varieties."

For the Bacon & Waffle, we all know how easy to prepare them.. but even the waffle was just mediocre. Honestly for that price range for such a simple dish, I expected much more. 

The same thing with the seafood pasta (S$23). It was just ok only. I've had better. The texture of the pasta is a bit wrong - like it was over cooked. Pasta is the easiest dish to make with high margin. I'm sure that I don't ask to much if at least I want my pasta to be al dente.

I only came here for some cake and I got the upside down pineapple cake. I don't know why but seeing a badly sliced and sloppily presented cake annoyed me. It shows a lack of care in the attentive-level of staff.

When I went to pay, I noticed that other cakes (of other flavors) were similarly badly sliced. Woah. 

I really did think Clinton St Bakery was better than this. 

Taste-wise, the cake was fine. Not great, not terrible. The staff was sufficiently polite. But I think the devil's in the details and they need to teach their staff how to slice cakes properly, lift the slices and place them on plates."

Ask for the stamp card if it is not automatically given to you, as you'll get a free coffee once your card is full.

The staff is cheerful and seems to love what they're doing. Food is quite good - I've had pasta, bacon & egg muffin and a ham & cheese melt before.

- This place is a classic case of hit or miss. If it's a hit, probably one of the best Hainese Chicken. 
- Expect to wait in line anywhere between 5 to 30 mins. 

Having visited Tiong Bahru market a lot,  I've typically had made by way  over to The Tiong Bahru Boneless Chicken stall for their Chicken and rice. But I must say this  place is a hit or miss for me. It's either super tender or dry and overly chewy pieces. 

Since the portion sizes are small 
I ordered the double meat portion steam/baked and bean sprouts. Total price 8 dollars.

Regarding lines, expect to waiting anywhere between 5 to 30 mins"

My current faves include:

#01-02: Hua Kee Hougang Famous Wan Ton Mee
The $5 portion of the dumpling noodle fed this hungry preggo lady well! I could've shied away from the chilli but I figured it wouldn't do the dish justice if I skipped it. The dumplings were stuffed to the brim and delicious. Throw in the copious amount of al dente noodles in a bowl and it is BEST.

#01-12: Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow
I love Char Kway Teow and am not very particular with my stalls. Just know this one does the dish justice.

#01-51: Waan Waan
This is a Thai dessert spot that does coconut ice cream. Their dishes are quite refreshing in this Singapore heat; however they do try to upsell me sometimes even though I tell them straight up that I'm not interested... not a fan of that.

Next time I want to try some of the curry puff stalls and the banana fritter stall in the back!"

Had wanted to have lunch Hua Bee Restaurant but had unfortunately got there too late. 

Deciding that it was way too hot and we were way too hungry to look elsewhere, we decided to give Flock Cafe a try, seeing how popular it was. 

Flock's Scrambled Eggs and Toast($7.50 + $2.50 for a side of baked beans) 
I have to admit, the scrambled eggs were pretty decent. Good texture, not over cooked. The sautéed mushrooms were forgettable, baked beans were.... well.... tasted canned and the sourdough was unfortunately pretty hard and crunchy (almost like a crouton). 

Scrambled Eggs & Croissant w/ Crispy Bacon ($15.90)

Scrambled Eggs, consistent with mine so that's a good sign. The croissant was pretty buttery and was nice and flakey. Bacons were fried nice and crispy (although I'm more of the juicy tender bacon person than the crispy sort).
The salad was an after though and came looking a bit limp and old. The most disappointing? The salad wasn't washed clean. The wife was just about to take a bit and suddenly noticed a dead ant on one of the lettuce leaves. Tsk tsk. Big disappointment. 

Overall, while the Eggs were pretty good but everything else seemed like an after though. Definitely not a place we're chose to come back to."

I love places that just make a few things but do them well. The Nanban Chicken bao was my favorite. The chicken is juicy, and the skin perfectly crispy and light, and the Japanese tartar sauce is just right. 

My wife had the classic pork belly and salted egg shrimp bao, which were also both excellent but not quite as good as the chicken for my taste. Lastly, their truffle fries were a bit on the salty side, but full of cheesy truffley goodness. 

Besides the food, the decor is right up my alley. Clean and modern, wide open spaces and gray and brown accents. 

Service was super fast, which is another big plus with places that have small menus. We had our bao in less than five minutes after ordering, which is great for a case of mid-afternoon munchies."

Like all Killiney's, this place located off Orchard was a regular place for me to go to get coffee.   Very good cheap breakfasts eats here.  For $S4.50 (about $US4), you can purchase a coffee, soft boiled egg, and French Toast.  They offer a take out as well.  The French Toast is similar to French Toast back at home (toast battered in egg) but unique in the kind of bread used and served with kaya, a coconut flavored jam that's pretty good.

I do not know how they do it, but their coffee, served with sweet condensed milk is always perfect.  I seldom drink coffee with milk or sugar, but when I come here, I have it the way they serve it and it's always the best."

The desserts are way over-hyped in my opinion and priced far beyond what they're worth. The churros and hot chocolate were the best dish we had but were nevertheless underwhelming and exceedingly bitter. The chocolate forest dessert was such an odd selection of flavours it was impossible to discern what the goal was. It is almost as if so much is attention to distinguishing the look of the dishes that the flavour profile is just sort of thrown together. I am sad to say this feels like a place seeming high-class by making its dishes rather obscure just for the sake of appearance.

Main attraction: waffles

A friend brought me here, she can't stop raving about this place's waffles. We alighted at Braddell Station and walked in between the HDB block to get to this cafe. Approx 5mins.

It's an old neighborhood, so it is fairly easy to find a parking lot if you plan to drive. 

Typical cutesy, cosy hipster cafe. Nothing over the top, generally well decorated. 

We ordered a Waffles with chocolate ice cream, cafe latte, citron tea and Mexican wings. Approx $22

They arrived fairly quickly. Waffles was good, and clearly they take pride in it - there is a dedicated chalk board to justify and tell people just why their waffles is so good and how they made them. In addition, the wifi password is ""crispywaffles"".

The coffee was below average, citron tea was ok. The Mexican wings were terrible. They all had a weird smell to them, felt like it was dunked in some detergent or cleaning solution. It was so bad, we had to stop eating them. Informed the staff when she cleared our plates, claims she will look it up but did not come back with a response. Instead, she sat down and watch her drama series.

I would have given them more stars probably 3/5. If not for them - disregarding customers feedback and the horrible wings. The one and only thing (maybe two) that you would visit this place for would be the waffles and maybe the ice cream."

Many items at Robot are made in-house.  This includes their light, buttery brioche, their flavoursome meatballs, and even their pesto, redolent of basil.  The food is one manifestation of the pride and effort the folks behind Robot put into all they provide; the warm hospitality is another which you won't fail to notice.  Attentive yet unobtrusive, always eager to share more on the provenance of their edibles - these guys are wonderful hosts.  This, despite its low prices for the area.  

I wouldn't necessarily speak in hyperbole about Robot*; it's more a ""consistent, high batting average"" kind of place.  It doesn't have ""the absolute best salad!"" I'd head to Salad Shop with its dozens of customisable options, though then I'd have to deal with massive lines and sometimes surly staff.  Nor does it have ""the absolute best coffee!"" For which I'd trek to Nylon at Everton, where the excellent folks do beautiful coffee, and only coffee.  But whatever does Robot serves they do do well, and I'm always very pleased to get my salad and coffee from them. 

Also, take note of the quirky, hand-painted murals. There's so much to spot!  Visiting Robot is like hanging out in the home of your cool, arty, ultra-foodie friends.

*Actually, Robot has the best cafe ambassador in the form of four-legged Baileys"

Both times I had the beef lasagne and the mixed fruit tea in a jug. 
The beef lasagne was quite small but it had a generous serving of cheese, tomato sauce and ground beef to make your mouth crave for more. The lasagne had potato wedges and a small serving of garden salad with it. The potato wedges is pretty average but the garden salad is very fresh!
The mixed fruit tea is delightfully sweet and has loads of fresh fruits like lychee, apples, oranges and strawberries in it!!!

The most extensive range of late night food you could probably ever find, and when you're tipsy, or tired, or happy, the food will still taste great no matter what. Even sober, the food here doesn't disappoint, and while it's no Tony Roma's or Chilis, but they do offer a great variety of Western and local wares to keep you satisfied.

I am a big fan of the fact that they server truffle fries here. Truffle fries! At 3 am in the morning, truffle fries are a godsend. Haha jokes aside, I have seasoned truffle fries connoisseurs tell me that the ones served here aren't half bad at all. Their food options cover the whole spectrum, from your fish'n chips, to prata, they have almost anything you could think of whilst inebriated. Or sober.

Here are a couple of the dishes I have tried which are mention worthy and some you should definitely try when visiting Spize. Their roti john chicken special - cheese, mushroom, chicken goodness on bread. Their maggi goreng seafood pattaya - maggi, with seafood and a tinge of orange spicyness wrapped in a hot omelette, nuff said. Their truffle fries - as mentioned above. Their fish and chips - fried crispy goodness with tonnes of fries. Their bangers and mash - good ol' sausages with creamy mashed potatoes and an equally tasty gravy to match. Their nasi goreng - they've got multiple variations of fried rice, be sure to give them all a try. There's a reason why there's more than one type. 

I could go on but you get the jist. I think the magic in this place is that it comes alive late at night, and is always full of sights and sounds way past midnight. Fantastic for eating those post party blues away. Also fantastic for drunk people watching at 4 am in the morning when you are hungry and cannot go to bed. 

Their only downside, when it gets crowded, be sure to expect that orders will slip through the cracks, and you may end up waiting for some time before those truffle fries finally arrive at your table."

You would feel uncomfortable here as there are no racks of reading materials, glowing filament bulbs, or shaggy bearded baristas with man buns. But what you will find at Doi Chaang is a friendly welcome and a helpful attitude. Searching for a late lunch, I came across Doi Chaang and was greeted by Joseph working the front of the house. He told me about their cafe's special organic coffee, which is ranked in the top 1% worldwide by Kenneth Davids, but you be the judge. With some help from Canadian backers, the beans are cultivated & exported by the Akha hill tribe in Northern Thailand.

For lunch, I decided on the recommended green curry rice which was tasty but typical, though the side of chili and baked egg & cheese was a nice touch. Permanently listed on the menu board are sandwich and waffle options. I spied also some cakes that looked pretty moist and fresh. The curry was likely a daily special. 

Ordering the iced Doi Chaang was perhaps not the best choice to enjoy the characteristics of the single-estate brew, but it was still quite enjoyable. Reminds me a bit like dark chocolate. Will need to return to try and try a naked cup next time. United Square Mall wifi is freely available."

The bar is spectacularly decorated with aeropress, drip filters and a dark horse like synesso. Everyone is sleek and well mannered. The staffs are extremely friendly and take the initiative to understand you and your dining experience. Spa Esprit persona score! 

Food is very flavourful, fresh, and delicious. A friend and I came here for lunch. Our food came quickly but it was served separately. So we had to wait for each other's food to arrive. Both of us ordered salads which were very refreshing. 

Coffee is good but I can't help to admit the ceramic cups are not meant for coffee drinkers like me. It is most preferredwith tea, but this is just personal. Nevertheless, the clay plates are amazingly beautiful which adds a whole new level to the dining experience. Have yet to return for desserts. But first, I need to save up. 

This place is pricey for their food. Definitely setting a different scene and drawing the coffee crowd to a wider approach to appreciating caffeine and food."

They have experienced party stylists to create bespoke dessert tables to suit any theme and occasions such as weddings, baby showers, parties, corporate functions and photo shoots.

Little House of Dreams also conduct baking workshops at their baking studios or at a location convenient for the customers. Their sister shop, Dreams and Confetti, offers a specially curated selection of party supplies, imported tableware, pretty cake stands from USA, candies, trinkets, gifts and much more.

Little House of Dreams has recently launched a new savoury food menu in December 2015 which features burgers, pastas, pizzas, salads, sides and sweet treats. One noteworthy point is that the dough for the burgers, pizzas and pasta are all hand made in-house at the Little House of Dreams.

REVIEW

The hot foods here are all prepared by their talented pastry chefs. As the Little House of Dreams' forte is in baking and bespoke dessert creations, we find that their savoury food items would require a little more fine tuning.

Being a fairly new establishment, the Little House of Dreams has great potential for growth, with their great desserts, cosy ambience and friendly service with a personal touch, and I will be happy to return to try their new offerings."

I got the set lunch, consisting of a salad/soup, main and dessert, for $38++. It was decent though not fantastic, main gripe though, was that the service was achingly slow. 

- Roasted pumpkin salad with Roquefort cheese: more pumpkin than rocket, and it was slathered in a heavy glaze. It was a bit heavy tasting, though the pumpkin went well with the cheese. 

- Grilled Norwegian salmon, chorizo and shaved fennel: presentation was good and the diced chorizo in beans was tasty. While the salmon skin was nice and crispy, the fish was slightly overcooked, tough and bland. 

- Sweet corn panna cotta, popcorn and truffle oil: slightly too firm but went nicely with the popcorn. The truffle undertone definitely added an interesting twist to the dish. 

I also heard good things about the hangar steak and prawn linguine that my friends opted for. 

Seems like the dinner items seem better than the lunch. Would love to return to try!"

Staff are not really attentive but otherwise friendly and warm when you get their attention. 

Let's talk about the food!
Aglio Olio - I like their version with sun-dried tomatoes thrown in. The pasta by itself is not very tasty but if you put some bits of sun-dried tomato and garlic slices into it, each bite can be quite delightful. This came with 6 juicy plump prawns that went great with the pasta. 

Beef Burger - They asked for the level of ""done-ness"" and added they only do medium and up. So I clarified that medium rare is no no and waitress repeated ""medium and up"". So we opted for medium and when the Burger arrived, we were surprised that the patty is very thick and when we cut into it, it was fairly pink. Strange for a 'medium'. 

Smoked Salmon Pizza - Fairly generous with the salmon slices. The pizza was toped with a drizzle of avocado mayo. Interesting combo. My girl liked it enough. 

Pepperoni Pizza - This pizza was really covered with pepperoni slices! With such a generous coverage of meat, how not to be nice? 

Tiramisu - Quite a decent bowl of ""yummy""! Really quite a good serving of tiramisu, not too dry nor wet, with loads of cheese. 

Can come back again!"

I've been here almost every time I'm doing some work on my laptop, and at the same time waiting for my boyfriend to finish his workout at a nearby crossfit box from here.

This place is like a hipsterized old warehouse.. I enjoy staying here for long hours Infront of my laptop. It gets really crowded during lunch hours, but at 4 onwards it gets super empty. Oh, and it's not that easy to spot this place from outside as it has no signage which is cool. It's not like the usual in-your-face type of place. It's a hidden gem with yummy food!

I've always ordered Brave Begedil - which is very yummy. The portion for this one is not very big, so if you are that hungry this meal wouldn't be that filling for you. I looove the turkey bacon! 

I've also ordered lavender latte. Iove love love."

Pastries, tarts and cakes looks absolutely delicious! Can't wait to come back next time to try them. They do have savoury and breakfast menu too. 

At this time of the day, things are quiet, two tables (besides myself) occupied. There are sofa seating are and tables and chairs, big enough of a setting.

The food however is pretty decent - the burger and wedges were good, moist and tasty although the burger could have been a slightly bigger portion for its price especially when you compare it to the big breakfast your neighbour is having next to you :P  

I had the ugly salmon cakes which were pretty good - the mash they used in the cakes were very buttery and tasty, but it could have done with some batter and extra time in the pan - and also some cheese I think.  Although simplicity in cooking is the key, these salmon cakes lacked a little depth in its flavour.  Otherwise no complaints, great portion size, and the salad that came with it was fresh.

What I found slightly strange was the iced mocha that I ordered - it really wasn't milky enough, as you could tell instantly from the colour. It didn't taste bad, just not what an iced mocha is really! There was an overpowering taste of chocolate / cocoa powder - bit too much for my liking."

Be sure to make reservations: we didn't think reservations were necessary on a Thursday evening, but boy were we wrong; the restaurant was a full-house, so we were ""banished"" to the counter seats at the bar.

We had:

1) 'Hail Caesar' ($25): a novel deconstruction of the classic green salad, with romaine lettuce cups cradling tender slabs of smoked chicken, layered with 5J jamon, the thickest ever parmesan crackers, slicked with a light horseradish caesar dressing, and finished with soft-boiled egg confit and garlic croutons. This was well-executed, elegant, incredibly balanced, and the best caesar salad I've ever had. A must-try.

2) Sweet Corn & Basil Soup ($19) chunked up with charred baby corn, caramelised onion strips, and mopped up by fluffy hunks of pita bread - velvety smooth and nuanced.

3) Mud Crab Pappardelle ($29): the sweet flecks of shredded crabmeat complemented the mild Thai curry gravy swirled with coconut milk, dotted with yellow squash, and topped with fried Thai basil leaves. Despite the spice, this was very restrained.

4) 48 Hour Barolo Braised Oxtail Strozzapreti ($26): unabashed and bold, the smoky sweet of the wine highlighted by the heft of the meat, and cut through by fresh thyme and parmesan crisps.

5) Coconut Laksa Barramundi ($29): outstanding as well, the skin of the fish seared to a tantalising crackling, yielding luscious moist flesh underneath. This was sided by an otah-potato cake blend, blanched bok choy and garnished with chilli oil beads that looked like ikura"

Second visit: Monday morning at around 9am. Ordered one of the breakfast sets, toast with avocado and coffee. This was incredibly disappointing. The toast, while good quality, was tiny. And the worst bit, the portion of avocado was unacceptably small. Not even 1/8 of an avocado was provided - just three and a half (barely) Super thin tiny slivers of avo which I had to strategically spread out in order to get some in each bite. After eating I felt like I hadn't even had breakfast. Really a shame they scrimp on this and ruin an otherwise great potential breakfast option. 

Would have been 5 stars but after my breakfast I cannot rate this cafe so highly."

La opera is not my thing. The espresso was so bitter, the overly sweet chocolate ganache, almond sponge is all too much. The best part? Dark espresso ice cream but more like just normal coffee ice cream. And you can get away with $4.50 for one scoop. My buddy Lippy and I paid $15.90 for a bunch of Bla. ya.... should have just gotten a Milo Dino McFlurry.  yup, nice ambience, nice service but the affogato not so nice.

Sipping a hot cup of coffee and biting into a warm butter croissant on a chilly winter day in Paris was the most memorable experience and I thought I could relive it here in Singapore at Paul Bakery.
 
Although the seating was really cramped, the interior of Paul did remind me of Parisian patisseries. The chandeliers, French paintings and even the waitresses in white chef hats really simulate the setting of French restaurants.
 
Food-wise, there were a few hits and misses. The highly recommended Chocolate Mellefeuille was a let down because the pastry was not crispy but limp instead. The chocolate flavor was good though, rich and not overly-sweet. The Praline Macaron was great, crusty on the outside and filled with creamy rich praline. The Caneles have a really good texture as well.
 
The service was slow, probably because they were short of staff. It was difficult getting the attention of the waitstaff and the food took pretty long to arrive."

The menu is really extensive, as is the seating. As a vegetarian, there are plenty of options - the usual nasi goreng and mee goreng (both about $4, as there are a few kinds) can all be done veggie style, though you might want to repeat your order a few times to make sure they get it right (this goes for anywhere, really).

They're on East Coast Road, and they're open till 11pm most nights, which I think is an amazingly smart move, since I only popped by when I got done with a late dinner and was looking for dessert. 

As the story goes, the founder is a French guy who started this business in Vietnam, before deciding it was a viably exportable brand. I realise at this point that I'm not telling you much about my experience here, so let's change that.

I had a great experience here. The staff member at the counter was lovely - she patiently (and pretty cheerfully) let me try half a dozen flavours, and even gave me suggestions. I settled on the Young Rice flavour, which reminded me of rice pudding, in a very good way.

She answered all my inane comments and questions, and I remembered being impressed by how she handled herself and the shop alone. She helped make this walk in customer a fan. Yes, I'm a fan. Of Fanny."

The lava cheese filling is velvety smooth, very creamy and rich.  I think they tweaked the cookie crust recipe a little, because the cookie tart shells are still crunchy two hours later from when we got home.  My eldest son loves to eat them semi frozen with a firmer center.

This place is open till late, and can get crowded over the weekend. There's a HUGE variety of dishes to pick from, so you'd be spoilt for choice. 

They have all kinds of pratas, both sweet and savoury, as well as murtabaks to choose from. I like the mutton and cheese murtabak. It's huge and stuffed with ingredients.

Rice or noodles? Take your pick. Most of the fried rice or noodle dishes here are pretty standard. Satay here is decent, but pricier than most other hawker centres. In fact, all the local dishes here cost a little more than average.

There's also a western menu available, but I've never tried any of those dishes. Neither have my friends, so I can't really comment on that.

The toilets here are usually filthy, and the floor is really oily. Tread carefully, especially if you are inebriated. They set up rows of tables and chairs on the walkway outside their shop, and the next 3 shops on either side.

Parking around here is a real pain when you've got the post-party crowd in. Most people park on the streets illegally. Watch out for drunk people crossing the road as well, as some of them park on the little streets across the road from Spize."

The chocolate sea salt cookies are an exact match to the Pierre Herme chocolate sea salt cookies - decadently chocolatey with the zing of salt to keep things happening. 
They also do a lovely crumbly buttery salted egg yolk cookie for Chinese New Year. 
The chocolate eclair is also very decent - some places have their eclairs sitting in the display cases slowly drying into cardboard crumbliness. But Patisserie G's eclair is fresh enough that the choux has a crisp shell and light interior. Helps too that the cream filling is usually richly flavoured. 
They've done well enough over the years to expand to additional seating outside the shop. I love their morning breakfast offerings - croque monsieur, buttery croissants and lightly brewed coffee.  
Good place to hang out, chill over a cuppa and a nicely made sweet."

Spacious location, well spaced tables, friendly staff are just a start. The real magic is in their food. Great ingredients and excellent combinations. We got the assembly brunch and the rendang Mac and cheese and we were beyond delighted with the food. It was timely, hot when served and the portions were generous. Pair it with one of their smoothies and you may be set for a wonderful day ahead."

There's an array of seating from stools to couches to tables with pillows. There's also outlets by some of the couches to give you enough juice to keep going for hours. The wifi was no fuss (no re-logging in and very speedy). 

Amazing coffee, including the drip coffee. I tried the Indonesian drip, which had a slightly more bitter flavor and tinge of sour. Lattes and signature coffees can be pretty pricey at S$7-9, but the drip is affordable at S$3.20.

Gets busy around lunch hour around 11-2pm, but quiets down during the mid-afternoon. Highly recommend for a place to chat with others, chill on your own, or hunker down and get some work done."

Very spacious space; great for events 
The food was passable ; not extremely fantastic but still pretty good. 

Had the pulled pork pasta - pork was a little too salty; wasn't spicy enough and slightly too oily : however it was okay 

Latte was Normal as well; so was the carbonara - nothing too memorable. 

Wouldn't go back especially for the food but is a good chill and nice hang out place after a run in the botanic gardens or for brunch out of the city"

Portions aren't massive, but they're pretty filling. 2 Blur Guys also serves desserts such as brownies and ice cream.

The mushrooms were delicious, consistent with my previous visit. The carbonara was decent but not a must have. The bouillabaisse and shepherd pie were a little disappointing, considering they were the chef's special. The portions were small and did not taste what I expected of a bouillabaisse and shepherd pie. The gula melaka cake is what made this review a 4 instead of 3 - it was a little sweet but would have been perfect with a coffee. 

I would still recommend coming if you need a halal restaurant and am in the area."

Even though the place is air conditioned it can be quite warm because of the glass ceiling letting the sun in. On a cooler day this place is great. Seats are comfy and the dessert looks good. 

My son had the Caramella Mixed Fruit Crepes and Raspberry milk shake. I had the cold brew 
coffee and my friend ordered the Dome Surprise. All these taste good! I liked the coffee and the Dome Surprise. The milkshake is a bit too sweet for me and my boy. 

The staff is available when you summoned them. They have 3 to tend to the whole place on a Sunday afternoon and yes they forgot my cold brew and milkshake. Had to remind them. 

Other than that it's been good to escape the crowd of the shopping area. Will try again when it's not so warm, maybe at night."

I also always order the lavender latte, which is amazing. No problems with the spare decor as there is plenty of clear table space, which is what I need more than tchotchkes all over the place."

Not familiar with the vibe which I guess is like an old timey coffee shop or harkens back to colonial times. Am always uncomfortable with that bc yeah it might've seemed cool but was not cool for the majority of those not in the elite. Anyhow it was cool enough in the evening inside and they had mixed chairs and cool wood floor etc. just be careful if ur inside and then you moved your chair back and one leg falls off the elevated floor and u could fall and hit ur head. The food was actually pretty good - the Indian food only. We had chicken not the spicy one and it was juicy and citrusy and delicious. Also had the Dahl and the baigan bartha and naan and plain rice and one more thing. But it was all tasty and very spicy but good. The service was meh. I asked for ginger ale and they said no we don't have it. I pointed out on the menu where it was listed. Was advised they don't have it anymore. Asked what on this list they had. They have juice and coke. There were five more things listed. Ok I'll just have water. Have to flag them down if you want anything so they don't check back. But at least they don't bother you and let u stay to chat. They're not clearing ur plates as soon as ur done which was my experience in most other restaurants in Singapore.

but for its class, the desserts are good - certainly worth a visit if you're into this sort of thing. there's no way to get around this - this place is pretty much fantastic for women (and persons inclined toward the delicate and feminine). it's a small white-walled space with a large window that lets in plenty of light at brunchtime, and the counter is laid full with colorful, dainty little cakes with all sorts of fancy frosting and glazes.

we had five cakes from the selection on offer that day - mango (the unanimously-declared winner of the day), strawberry, yam, chocolate and blueberry - and whilst there was a mix of textures from millefeuille and the sponges, all the cakes felt the same.

everything's certainly gorgeous - but all a little too light and substantial. of course, this opinion speaks more of my preferences than the skill of the kitchen; if you're into this sort of thing, it does well enough (and you might also want to try its famous ex-chef's new venture: his eponymously-named chef yamashita)."

The menu is stripped back and simple - choose from coffee/tea kaya/kaya french toast all for the equivalent of about 5 quid.  This is a stripped back (as others have mentioned) cafe and if you're in a rush it's probably best to order at the counter and take it to go - once you seat yourself it's all about getting the attention of the staff, so you definitely need to make your presence known by a few waves and constant eye contact. My food came out piecemeal - coffee, then 10 minutes later eggs, and another 15 later the toast but luckily I had the whole morning to hang around so enjoyed people watching in the interim.  This was clearly a super popular spot, and you can see why. If you like a breakfast on the sweeter side, you'll likely enjoy this runny egg/jam and french toast like concoction with sweet Singapore coffee. Be prepared for the sugar rush that follows and don't forget to bring your own wet wipes/napkins (probably an obvious for most of you used to Singapore but I was constantly walking around with sticky hands!)"

I don't usually start my reviews like that so that's how good an impression it made on me. We stumbled upon it completely by accident and thought it was going to be overpriced and modified local food not done well. Boy were we wrong.

The ambience was nice with a touch of local culture such as the old fashioned shutters in the corner. We tried the sng muay pop and the milo dinosaur for drinks and both were impeccable. Especially the milo dinosaur (I confess my love for milo now but there is nothing more heavenly than a milo dinosaur done right)

The har jeong Kai wings for starters turned out great as well, juicy with a slight crisp. The mains were good too. The crab bee hoon was hearty and tasty and the nonya kiam chye arg tasting relatively authentic.

Didn't have space for dessert but I guess that means an excuse to visit again. And that's nothing to complain about."
