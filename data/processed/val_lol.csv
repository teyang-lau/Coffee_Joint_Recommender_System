It's yet another place for coffee snobs than for a nice casual and affordable breakfast or brunch.

I'll take simple and affordable any day over high-end looks and coffee. Like Italian food, breakfast does not need to be expensive. Any diner in the US does it better, cheaper, friendlier, faster, and with more options, than anywhere I've seen in Singapore. 

They do have good service and good quality eggs.  The saltiness and olive oil on the eggs killed the taste for me, to where I struggled to eat them; our waitress dismissed my dissatisfaction as they being ""healthy"" that way. A Big No for future patronage.

French toast was a bit small for $18.

Warning: For those who don't like added oil on your eggs, be sure to specify without; 

I see it like pepper - don't put it on people's food unless you ask them first, mention it on the menu, and better yet, rather than serve it with, have it on the table for the customer to do for themselves. 

I originally gave it a high three stars for the overall quality of ingredients and atmosphere, but revised it to two (because there is no 2.5 option) as in reality, we have not been back since this visit months ago in favour of other places, and are not likely to return except out of boredom of our regular brunch places.",4

Pastry chef Alfred Chan once baked in the kitchens of Shangri-La, but prefers baking in the heartlands where he has the opportunity to interact with his customers. His years of expertise has made him a master in desserts, which led to the opening of Drips, a quaint cafe in the charming Tiong Bahru neighbourhood, to the benefit of us mortals who can't afford to dine at Shangri-La. 

I am a big desserts fans (a girl always has stomach for sweets!), and fruit tarts are easily one of my most favourite form of after meal delights. I've always been a ice cream or cake kind of girl, until I discovered the fruit tarts at Drips. Sweet pastry shells are filled with delicious custard, then generously stacked with fresh fruits (the strawberries on their tarts are the biggest I've seen in Singapore). I don't think my words will do the tastiness of these tarts justice. All I can say is, you don't know fruit tarts until you've tried the ones at Drips. These precious tarts tend to run out quickly so I wish you all the best in coming at the right time. 

The reason why I gave Drips four stars is because their mains are rather mediocre. I would suggest that you enjoy a cheap and hearty meal at Tiong Bahru market a few minutes' walk away before coming here for dessert.",6

Not this one. The outlet is hidden in an office building at Buona Vista, which means that its usually quite empty on a weekday morning or afternoon. 

It is extremely accessible, just a short walk away from a few bus stops and the soon-to-come One North MRT station on the circle line. Do take note that it is also near to several schools like ACJC and Fairfield Secondary School, and may oget a little packed after school hours or during examination periods. If you plan to visit on a weekend, come early to secure a good seat, especially if you need a powerpoint. 

It is one of the perfect spots to spend a quiet day alone regardless if it is to read a book, write, study or just watch the world go by. The staff is also extremely friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make your day. I've seen on various accounts whereby staff members ask around for those willing to share a seat to help other customers that are looking for a seat to enjoy their beverage or food. Customer requests are also taken seriously, like heating up a muffin for only 5 seconds.

So, here's the story. Celebrated my birthday at this cafe in May this year with my gal friends. 4 of us ordered a few mains and a dessert to share. I gotta say we were all very happy with the food. I especially love the 2 main dishes: Fuwa Fuwa Hoshino Soufflé with Porcini Rissoto Tomato Cream and Omu Rice with Shrimp & Mozarella. Just writing about them and looking at their yelp pictures are making me hungry now. 

Their dessert item, Double Pancake Soufflé Style is also recommended. It is so big I am sure it can feed 8 instead of the 4 of us. Love the service here! Definitely one of the few places in SG where you can enjoy good and cheery service at a mid-priced eatery. Good service is just super hard to find in SG #sadfactoflife.

I have been coming to this cafe chain over the years. My favourite outlet is still this Plaza Singapura one. After writing this review, I have the urge to visit it soon. Think I gotta make it real soon. #whydoeswritingreviewsmakeonehungry?",7

After my $60 purchase and taking all sorts of pictures of the box, bag, and the store's selections, and my purchase... I can say w/ confidence that these ARE the best I have ever had. The macarons are incredibly light, airy and the filling is smooth, rich, and decadent. I ordered 15. I finished it in 2 days. I had the chocolate, coffee, and salted caramel. 

The girl behind the counter was very patient w/ me, super soft-spoken, and welcoming. I did not intend to buy that many but how often am I going to be in Singapore?! Plus my GM said I can expense my chocolate/dessert purchases. What? I have the best job, the best manager, the best customer, and the best team. 

I did many hours of cardio for these. It was so worth it!!",6

The cashier lady was an older obasan who was extremely patient and kind with us as we scoured the display window for a avoid-the-sun snack. We decided on dan ta's each, their powdered bread...which I totally forgot the name! The baked goods weren't spectacular, but that's because we're spoiled with delicious California baked goods and cheap/fresh Taiwanese bakery bread when we travel.

Their dan ta has a crunchier and thinner (not flaky) crust and sweeter egg in the center. It was pretty good, just made differently and just as fresh. Their powdered bread was not the business. We felt like it was just bread with powdered sugar on top...nothing special. Looking around, we saw that they also offered other baked sweets as well as more ""kitchen-made"" orders like soups and porridges. 

It's great to get a dan ta if you're in the Ann Siang Hill/Chinatown area, but it's not some place I would say is a ""distinguishing"" part of Singaporean local eats.",9

The vanity just got the best of me :( )

When I finally got out and joined my sister for lunch at the café, I sat down and flipped through the menu. Before I texted my sis before to go ahead and order first. A bespectacled server came to me, demanded rudely that if I was not planning to eat anything, I must put on a mask. Was she kidding?? Why must she be so rude?? 

I countered back ""Yea!! I am eating!!"" 

During Phase 2 after the ""Circuit Breaker"" (aka shelter in place"", everyone in Singapore still needs to wear a mask when they are out and about. People can now dine in restaurants with social distancing procedures in place. 

Back to that server, why must she used that kind of tone to talk to me, a customer?? Ugh.. again I have to say this.. is it that hard to be polite to paying customers (Reminded me of that rude server at TCC restaurant @ Marina Bay Sands last year) ? Where was her service or manners?? She should simply say this:   ""Hi there! Sorry, if you do not plan to be eating, would you please put on your mask? Thank you for your understanding!""

It is NOT that hard!!!!! 

My sister just asked me to eat whatever she ordered which were already served at the table. I may not kick a big fuss there, I surely not going to let this slide. I would throw hands the next time I visit there. I really wanted to try the soufflé pancake!

My mood was ruined but I had to say the seafood pancake was really good! There was also this basket of korean chickens which was not bad either. The ginseng ade was really good!

Ambience here is definitely 5 stars. Service was a 0 (the owner should thank their rude staff). I would give the food a 4.

Will come back and update after I return for their soufflé pancake.",22

Also, their coffee is so good..  This is not normal coffee..  Just to give you an idea, Starbucks coffee level 3, coffee from here is level 8.  Coffees are specially brewed by barista to perfection.  It takes time to receive the order but worth it.

I also ordered Ice Chocolate glass bottle drink because I love the bottle...  Not only the bottle looks pretty, taste is even better.  Very deep rich taste.  Employee told me these are made and prepared daily.  Very good but expensive compare to other items..

What I Love: The options for food here is great - I love the Drinks & Desserts stall, the Fried Hokkien Mee, Char Kway Teow, Orh Luah and Ah Balling are yummy to the max. From the Drinks & Desserts stall, I would recommend the Coconut Juice, Water Chestnut Drink & Ice Kacang. The other Desserts are yummy too - but I always have the Ice Kacang there. There is a Seafood Stall that's really famous at the end of the street - it sells Ikan Bakar, Deep Fried Baby Squid, and quite a few other local delicacies. The City Satay stall is FAB!!! Gotta TRY!!! Hard to get yummy Satay in Singapore - so I do feel that they do pretty good ones.

Yes! After a temporary closure due to staff training, Craftsmen Specialty Coffee, which specializes in coffee and cakes, had a reopening just few days ago.

Besides from the food options, they also have appliances for sale here.

Dutch Colony Coffee Co.'s blends are used here. The Flat White ($4.50) tasted strong and firm, yet has a low acidity that everyone can enjoy.

The bakes and pastries here are supplied by online bakery Fathiscakes and Bonheur Pattiserie. The Salted Caramel Popcorn ($8.90), one of the cakes baked by Fathiscakes, is firm and satisfying. The caramel taste is just right; flavourful and not too sweet. Add a pinch of salt with popcorns on every mouthful and this will became a delightful cake to have.

The location also meant that it is a quiet respite for people to relax with a cup of coffee or to study in during the day. With its reopening, the Siglap / East Coast area has now yet another cafe to be added to its list.",16

The place wasn't too hard to find from the nearby bus stop (you might have parking problems if you're driving though!) and the ambience was decent. 

There are lots of nostalgic stuff laid all over the place which makes the overall ambience quite cosy - albeit a little forced, as another Yelper mentioned in his review. 

Having gone down mainly for dessert. A friend and I ordered a flat white, the crunchie hazelnut and a tiramisu to share among us. 

I take pride in my coffee and I can honestly say the flat white was nothing special - a little too flat (pun unintended) actually. 

The crunchie hazelnut and the tiramisu looked great and I thought it would at least make up for the disappointing coffee. 

I was wrong. 

The crunchie hazelnut had an overwhelming taste of fresh cream that made it far too sweet for both our tastes. 

The tiramisu came with a serving of espresso - which was something I had never seen before, and for good reason. Without the espresso, the tiramisu tasted entirely of marscapone. Even with the espresso poured in, it still felt pretty... off. I couldnt taste any kahlua liqour in the tiramisu with or without the espresso, which to me, sealed the deal as one of the poorest tiramisus I've had. If you want a good tiramisu, try out Kith Cafe at Park Mall - it's far better. 

The place was also quite noisy, so if you're looking for a quiet place to hang out with friends or loved ones, take note. 

I didnt try any of the food items, but the lamb ribs and wagyu burgers other people were eating looked quite appetitizing.  But then again, so were the desserts we ordered.

Not coming back to this place again. At least the service here was something worth mentioning.",4

What's lovely about it is you can manage to comfortably get lounge seats on a weekend evening. And there's no queue, not much of a crowd throughout the night. Yes, it's QUIET. A rare gem I would say.

I also really admire the fact I could drink coffee, look up and there you are, a TOILET BOWL complete with toilet paper right above my head. It's so randomly ridiculous yet genius that I LURVE IT. I even took a picture of it, go see.

I ordered the banana bread pudding, - $14, and coffee. The presentation of the bread pudding was very cute, it came in a pot, on a wooden slab. Coffee was better than most cafes I've been to, and service was... Let's just say that they let you do your own thing, and they do theirs, and if both lines should intersect, colourful unicorns will bloom. Pricing is on the high side.

One thing that made me feel like getting up to leave, was the glaring red neon lighting fixture, that engulfed me and my companion. It reminded me of an episode in Seinfeld (who else still watches this?!) where Kramer's entire room emitted a red glow because Kenny Rogers moved opposite his room and their crazy signboard faced his window.

The staff were perhaps somewhat surprisingly very friendly, not stuffy, we saw them taking photos for groups and even allowing people to chose when they were served, so full marks here.

The food was enjoyable, and the inclusion of a buffet of Asian dumplings and extra sweets was nice; though I was a little disappointed that some of the sweets appeared in both the served tray and buffet... A minor issue really.

As a once off experience when visiting Singapore I would recommend this, though there was nothing that would excite me to repeat my dining experience from the high tea perspective.",4

There were some citrus notes, but they were secondary to the intense bitterness which followed in the aftertaste, and which lingered long after the shot had been finished. The bitterness is dominant in this shot, with some harsh elements present also. This may not be an issue for pour over coffees, or americanos, where the end product is diluted with hot water, however an espresso shot is more concentrated, which can exacerbate harsh notes. There are a number of different types of coffee beans available however, and D'Good offers customers the option of choosing their own preferred type. It may be advisable to highlight this more prominently at the ordering counter though - it is certainly a selling point that not all cafe's in the area offer. 

Cappuccino - there are some large bubbles present in the foam, but not in sufficient quantities to affect the texture. The latte art is nicely executed also. The mouthfeel is dominated by the texture and taste of warm milk, rather than the hybrid of milk and microfoam that can work in conjunction to form a smooth hybrid of taste and texture. The flavour of the underlying espresso shot is somewhat diluted by the milk, but the bitter aftertaste is still discernible. This may be entirely subjective, but the intense citrusy bitterness described above may work better with pour over coffee, rather than with milk based drinks. However, as there are a number of bean varieties available, and the ability to customise drinks, this can quite easily be fixed, and may not even be an issue from week to week.

Staff are friendly and accomodating to requests, noticing when customers are looking for sugar or water, and stepping in to help. Also, thought and effort has clearly gone into the decor and layout, with an intelligent use of space allowing for lots of seating space, as well as a very pleasant al fresco area on the upper level. Busy periods can cause delays however (just as they would in any cafe), with a delay in used cups and plates being cleared, and tables being cleaned. Staff seem clustered in the kitchen and ordering counter area instead, but it should be noted that they did collect plates from the upper level before the end of my visit. Increasing the frequency of staff checks on the upper level may help.

The ordering counter can become crowded, and as a result customers collect drinks after they have been prepared. This may be to keep the ordering counter clear, but one minor issue is that drinks can be slightly less warm when the are collected. This is a minor issue though, keeping the ordering counter and roasting space clear is a good reason for doing so. 

At $14.50 for a single espresso and 2 cappuccinos, the prices are about right. There is also a selection of cakes and baked items available, as well as syphon and pour over coffee.

Overall, this is not a bad cafe by any means, with some admirable traits - a good selection of beans and brewing methods, and a micro roastery - everything I look for in a quality cafe, and I genuinely want D'Good to succeed. With some minor changes to the beans used for different drinks, and to the frequency of checks on the upper levels, this could be a very good cafe in a great location.",11

Let me explain. 

I organized a potluck brunch on Sunday and my American friend brought a giant brown bag to lunch. I was all ""hrmph who brings store bought food to a potluck?"" as I cooked my organic sausages from Ryan's when he said, ""I brought bagels"". That made me almost drop my sausages right there.

Bagels?!! In Singapore? ""

""Please tell me it's not those expensive things masquerading as bagels from 'New York' that are sold in Cold Storage?""

""Nope it's from Two Man. It's right by my house, I chat with them all the time and they make awesome, as-good-as-it-gets-in-Singapore bagels...oh and try the walnut cinnamon raisin something magic spread in that tub and thank me later.""

At that point I was pretty stoked to find the bag contained TWENTY bagels in a gazillion flavors. I couldn't find a sesame bagel (cos I'm boring like that) but I found a brown raisin one, popped it in the toaster and generously spread the magic stuff on. 

Oh. Ma. Gawsh. 

Oh. My.

I ate that bagel in about a minute. And then I ate a half more.

It was crisp on the outside and had a good chew. Granted it isn't New York or Bodo's great, but hey we're in Singapore.

It also doesn't hurt that the menu includes kick-ass mains such as the oriole burger and grilled NZ lamb rack, as well as flavourful pastas. I would end the meal with a light dessert, either the eton mess or the apple strudel, along with a flat white or the americano.

I'm a huge fan of truffle fries and I order it almost every single time I end up in a restaurant with truffle fries on the menu. Seriously give the truffle fries here a try. 

I had the P.S. House salad, and added the rosemary-honey dijon chicken. I think this was one of maybe like 3 times in my life I've ever felt satisfied after eating a salad without craving a burger or something. The salad was well balanced and I love the dressing. The chicken was very well seasoned and surprisingly tender.

The food was excellent, but I must mention that the service was not fantastic. We put our names down on their iPad checkin system, but we waited for half an hour without being seated even though the place had a couple of empty tables. We went up there and asked a server how long more we would have to wait (we were the only customers waiting), and she said another half an hour in a pretty flippant manner and walked away. We got pretty confused then, since we were told that the wait was half an hour pretty much half an hour earlier, and now we're supposed to wait another half an hour? When she came back we told her our name was in the system, and only then she led us to a free table.

My friend ordered the same salad as I did, and told them to leave out the rocket. The waiter noted that down and said it was no problem. When the salad came surprise surprise it came chock full of rocket leaves. We called the waiter back and he said the kitchen premixes the salad, so they couldn't take it out. Well before I get started on a kitchen that premixes a $25 salad, if you can't take out the rocket at least let us know before you serve it and ask if we're still ok with having it.

I only took away 1 star because the food is good although it is pricey, but I really hope the service improves.",4

Don't be put off by the roadworks outside, because behind the front door Flee Away is an escape from the noise and heat outside. It's a cafe, but with a twist. Yes you can eat and drink, but look closer at the menu for a few surprises. And while you're flexing those eyeballs, look up at the walls and ceilings for old antique trinkets that make you feel like you're in a child's bedroom. There are perspex boxes by the front door and inside you will find locally made nick-nacks that you can buy and take home. A great spot for unique gifts with a Singapore flavour.

The menu is intriguing. There's familiar flavours like Chicken Curry and Laksa, but they're served up in entirely inventive ways. The Chicken Curry ""sandwich"" was incredibly tasty, though I'm glad to have shared one as it was incredibly rich. I don't even know what the ""bread"" was but apparently it's a well known Chinese food item that is never used in sandwich format. 

The same innovation extends to the drinks menu, especially the milkshakes.  At Flee Away you can order fun milkshakes like ""Happy Birthday"" flavour that features cake mix inside. Why eat Red Velvet Cake when you can drink a milkshake that tastes like it? 

The coffee isn't going to win any awards for third wave artistry, but it's passable and comes served in a cute teacup loaded with little lion biscuits in the side. 

The ambience here is nice, with great music and staff who really want you to have fun and enjoy yourself. You won't feel bad spending some hours here working or reading, so feel free to bring a book and settle in with some food and drinks.",6

First, as it is on Keppel Island, it is a little off the beaten path.

The room is modern yet classic.  This is the type of room that defines what I expect from a fine dining experience.  My only issue with the ambiance is that, even on a Friday evening, the restaurant was almost completely empty.  This means the evening was missing the energy brought by other diners enjoying their meals.

The staff is excellent.  They are friendly and professional.  But, more than that, they demonstrated an eye for detail and took extra steps along the  way to insure we enjoyed our meal.

The food ranged from below average to excellent.  It is this level of inconsistency that left this just short of a five star dining experience.

The meal was extremely well paced.  The staff had a knack of being there when needed.  The server was very helpful with our questions concerning the menu.  The food came in a perfect and never rushed order.

After we had selected the bottle of wine, they brought an amuse bouche of sashimi.  When I communicated to the server that my dining companion can not eat raw seafood, the server quickly whisked hers away.  Soon after, a replacement of grilled watermelon was brought out.

We usually order starters to share.  However, on this evening, we went our own ways.  We shared small bites but, for the most part,  we stuck to our own appetizers.

I chose:

JAMÓN IBÉRICO BELLOTA  (Saffron Pear Chutney, Tomato Bruschetta) 

This was very good.  The Iberian ham itself was excellent.  The sweet tomatoes provided a nice contrast to the ham's saltiness.   The bread was simply there as an organic spoon.

She chose:

PRIVÉ GRILL'S CAESAR SALAD (Poached Egg, Bacon, Shaved Aged Parmesan, Garlic Croutons, Anchovies)

First, my friend ordered this without the sliced anchovies.  From my taste and watching my dining companion easily complete it, this seemed like a very successful rendition of a classic.  The only negative was the large shavings of Parmesan were a little difficult to navigate.  They may have been a little form over function.  The salad would have been easier to eat with an even distribution of smaller shavings .

My Main:

NEW ZEALAND ""HARMONY"" ORGANIC (Sourced only from free-range farms, Harmony's cattle are all 100%grass-fed in open pastures. - RIB-EYE 340g) - 

Hmmm, with all of that fancy talk, I expected a melt in my mouth spectacular steak.   It simply was not to be.  It was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  However, through lack of seasoning or some other misstep, it was rather bland.  While not tough, it was also not as tender as I expect from a high quality rib-eye.

TWICE BAKED POTATOES (Bacon, Sour Cream, Chives)

This was barely edible.  It was more akin to overcooked baked potato than twice baked potato.  I love potatoes.  I really do.  For me to walk away from a potato, there has to be something seriously wrong with it.

Her Main:

JOSPER-ROASTED WHOLE SEA BASS (Confit of Garlic Bulbs, Lemon Caper Sauce) 

Every show has a star, and for this meal, the sea bass was certainly the diva.  It was tender.  It was buttery.  The garlic and the lemon were provided in a way that they were complimentary without dominating the flavor of the delicate fish.  This is how a fish should be served.  Unfortunately, it was hers and I only was given remnant bites here and there.

One last little touch, when asked about dessert, we looked at the menu.  We both decided we simply could not eat anything else.  After we told our server, she soon returned with a small bag containing a slice of carrot cake for us to share later.  

The receipt:

Overall, this was a very good dining experience.  The service was excellent.  All the ambiance required was the buzz brought by additional diners.  The food certainly had some very high points but there were also some low ones.  In the end, we both enjoyed our time at Privé Grill.

(Special note: We  topped it off with a lovely and very peaceful walk along the water.  This is definitely a secondary perk from dining here.)",4

I really loved my latte (for the first time in Singapore) - finally one that wasn't overly bitter. Melbourne folks continue to meet the stereotype of being coffee experts. 

We also had a vanilla-Nutella milkshake. I was a little surprised that it was watery like milk (instead of thick like american shakes) but it was still super tasty!

Why have you fallen so far so fast? I remember when you first opened. I bounced in all wide-eyed and innocent, was seated promptly and fed delicious coffee and scrumptious food in a timely manner. I felt like this was a standout for Singapore's crowded brunch/cafe scene. I felt like I'd discovered a new world full of wonder, magic and beauty.

Fast forward 6-12 months and cynical business management and poor execution have sunk an otherwise promising business. It was Chinese New Year and Symmetry was one of the few places open. I'm not complaining, I still need places to go on public holidays. But when a restaurant remains open it's a warning sign. It's more difficult to get produce, there are less places open so crowding is a danger. But none of those things should be an excuse to provide a sub-standard service or product. Which on this occasion Symmetry most definitely did.

Let's see. Configuration of the tables had changed to cram in more diners so we were cheek-by-jowl. I felt like I needed to execute a triple somersault to get from my table to the door and back. Not comfortable.

Then it took 45 minutes to get two plates of moderately fancy eggs. We're not talking about slow-roasted ox-cheek and duck confit here. Just some slightly fancy modifications on poached eggs, that's all. 

Hey your kitchen can't handle a full restaurant at lunchtime? That's a problem for you. If you have 30 covers and you can't feed 30 covers on a limited lunch menu with simple dishes then you shouldn't have 30 covers. Maybe you shouldn't be in business. Just sayin.

So how's about those poached eggs? They were frankly pretty terrible. I ordered the ""sur le plat"". Hey everyone - don't give your dish a fancy French name, it raises expectations. The sur le plat was like virgin sex: quick, uneventful and unsatisfying. It was subtle like beating someone over the head with a fire extinguisher. Maybe it gets the job done but it isn't worth the effort.

I was promised ""artisanal bread"" and good quality sausages. I got a crusty piece of butter-slathered cardboard and what tasted like supermarket-quality frankfurters chopped up and served lukewarm in a saucepan. And the eggs. Oh the eggs. How do you undercook poached eggs? You know those half-boiled eggs you eat with kaya toast? They have a very unique consistency somewhat reminiscent of what one might use for inseminating the *other* kind of egg. Y'all know what I'm talking about. 

And that's fine. I love half-boiled eggs. But I ordered poached eggs. And these eggs were definitely not poached.

I'm sorry Symmetry but even a halfway passable coffee and service with a smile did not save my abominable experience. Never coming back.",14

But the nail in the coffin was when the lid of the coffee cup was not closed properly by the barista and my colleague had coffee on his white shirt, pants and shoes when he drank from the cup. No apologies from the barista who swiftly proceeded to take the order from the next customer instead. And this was in the morning before work. Needless to say, that was an awful start to work.

Situated in a fairly non-descript coffee shop, Sheng Chen char kway teow is located in a small hole-in-the-wall units beneath a HDB block. Nonetheless, they've managed to garner quite a loyal fanbase, as evidenced by the trickle of maids streaming in for takeaway orders, and the fair number of newspaper cuttings displayed. I really enjoyed the cripsy pork lard, as well as the fresh cockles, freshly shucked every morning by the auntie. It had just the right about of chilli, and the firmness of the noodles was just right (though some might prefer it a little softer). 

At $2.50 a plate, it's a sinful treat on the cheap. While paling in comparison to the epoch of char kway teow that is Hill Street in Bedok, this is definitely one of the best traditional wok-fried versions you'll find in the south of Singapore.",11

A homegrown favorite SPRMRKT has expanded and set up shop at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute (STPI) Creative Workshop & Gallery. I've walked past several times but only noticed their bistro concept SPRMRKT Daily. Little did i know that their Kitchen & Bar, which serves refined European food, is tucked away upstairs through a side stairway.

The spot is absolutely gorgeous in the day with expansive views of the idyllic riverside. Lunch sets are offered, starting from $30, served with coffee or tea. They have also started their weekend brunches and we say grab a table now!

For lunch, start with a simple but wholesome Brussels & Roots with a honey clove dressing. The vegetables are simply steamed- golden baby beetroots and baby turnips along with the Australian Brussels sprouts. The garden of greens is flavored with pops of umami from the slow-baked tomatoes seasoned with thyme, garlic, sea salt and olive oil.

For lunch, go for a lighter Pan-Roasted Chilean Sea Bass. The fish is seared and basted with butter, then finished in the oven with a simple touch of salt, pepper, and lemon juice. A refreshing ratatouille adds a juicy crunch to the mix. We agreed with the chicken stock flavored polenta which was rich and velvety with some Parmesan sharpness.

For dinner, the Firefly Squid ($24) surprised us with a bacon-like smokiness in the meatless cauliflower puree. I have no idea how but i'd take all the cauliflower puree as a guiltless replacement. The special firefly squid from Japan is intensely flavored, having been marinated overnight in soya sauce, sake, mirin and brown sugar. 

Definitely order the Octopus & Prawn ($24). This has to be one of the best (if not the best) Spanish octopus i've eaten this year. The octopus is simmered whole with mirepoix and other spices and white wine for 2 - 3 hours before grilling on a plancha. The crispy skin and that tender flesh were unforgettable.

I didn't like the Fjord Trout ($19). I'm not sure if it's due to the way it's cooked- mi cuit style, sous vide with salt, but the flesh was mushy and powdery. The flavor was great, just not the texture. 

Fresh pasta are a must these days. If you like something really meaty, the Malbec Oxtail Pasta ($32) with a smoky Scamorza will satisfy. The oxtail is braised with Malbec (my favorite wine) to impart that berries, plum, and chocolate flavor. Perfect comfort food. Can i have another glass of Malbec to go with this please?

A favorite at SPRMKT is the Smoked Lobster Tail ($42) which features a cold smoked and then seared Maine lobster with toasted garlic panko bread crumbs and a Mac n Cheese. The cheese sauce is a lot lighter than usual as they have added pumpkin puree to the Emmental, aged Parmesan, and Mozzarella mix. 

I absolutely love the Twice Cooked Chicken Roulade ($28). I've not had a chicken so good in a while. The juicy chicken thigh is brined overnight and then rolled with a creamy spinach and mushroom duxelle, before being cooked sous vide and then shallow fried for that amazing Peking-duck-like crispy skin. It's great on its own, with its own jus, or with the amazing curry cauliflower puree (seriously they are so good with their cauliflowers). 

I can go on forever about the other tender juicy red that is the Stockyard Côte de Boeuf ($94). This 200 days grain-fed 600g Australian bone-in beef ribs is good for 2. The ribs are first coated with a house made Creole spice rub before being seared and roasted. Drizzle a little of that beef jus made with roasted bones, red wine, tomatoes, and veal jus for some tart umami. The meat is served with mixed mushrooms, roasted rosemary tomatoes and vine-ripened tomatoes. Perfect date meal!

End your meal with a fragrant and light Earl Grey Creme Brûlée ($16) scented with a lemon lavender streusel base and fresh seasonal fruits.

For something rich and earthy, the Three Beet Chocolate Lava Cake ($18) delighted us with the medley of textures created with the versatile root.

Heavy on the modern industrial look - black, dark wood and metal furnishings; but not uncomfortable. Goes very well with the coffee machines that sit along the counter. Perhaps that is what attracts the good mix of patrons. Spacious with three seating areas. We took the front porch section.  
Service was prompt and unpretentious. 
Menu is not extensive. But they have a small selection of all-day sandwiches. Ordered one from the breakfast section and one from the sandwiches section. The steak sarnie was tasty enough. I wish I could enjoy it better if the bread was a little less toasted. Enjoyed the french toast with turkey bacon and caramelised banana. Well, if you are one of those who likes savoury and sweet in one bite. The coffee was good, and the tea was served in a small teapot with double wall glass tea cup. That won us over.

Prices are not cheap (as with most organic produce in Singapore). While they have their own organic farm in Shanghai (why China I wonder...), the fresh produce looks to be mainly from Australia. 

The dried grocery are all healthy and wholesome. Case in point: you can't even find white rice here, only brown rice, quinoa, etc. 

There's also a restaurant and cafe that serves up food that's sold in their supermarket. You get the pasta, pizza, sandwiches and even hotpot.

My friend also seemed to thoroughly enjoy her ice chocolate, for those who don't particularly like coffee. I had the coney dog, while my boyfriend had the blackened tuna burger and my friend ordered the beef ragout with rosti. I wouldn't say it was spectacular, just a regular frankfurter it seems with a slightly sweeter than expected beef chilli but it fulfilled my chilli dog craving and as such, I'd give it 3 stars.

You can have a choice of udon or Japanese rice inside the broth. We chose the rice and it may make it look like porridge. But very delicious and comforting. Matcha tea also helped us end the meal well. 

Ala carte prices are around $12-13 (excluding GST and svc charge). Sets are around $16. A great place if you'd like a Japanese-esque light and comforting meal for lunch without the crowds",12

FUKIEN MEIN ... heard some loud crazy wok action and smelt the ""鑊氣"" ! Turned the corner and noticed a line forming decided to get into the action.. had this already at Lau pasat but this one was better. The noodles and gravy had that extra flavour due to more of the 鑊氣. 

I was actually content BUT saw another line so I mosied up behind an uncle ... and raised my victory fingers when asked how many cus my mouth was drawing a long sip if the sour sop!! 

2 X POPIAH... I would have to say one of the best so far... in SG if u want to ward off vampires eat their popiahs.. man they use a lot of garlic. But at this stall it was the right amount of everything. sauce garlic and the crunchy thingy bob

Soursop.. um watered down but still decent for $2

Chicken rice.. the line was getting crazy luckily I joined 5 min early otherwise would be waiting around corner. Again hmmmm chicken was good but rice was a let down..

Considering I am not quite a carb-person, I fell in love with the Grimbergen Ambree bread ($8), a Grimbergen (Belgian abbey beers) infused bread created by Head Baker Audrey from Freshly Baked at Killiney Road. (No wonder the bread and cakes taste so familiar. The KPO probably approached her since they are 'neighbours'.) The bread is very wholesome, full-bodied and hearty, with a slightly rustic feel to it.

Seafood linguine ($21) - 5 stars
Stellar! They braise the linguine in lobster bisque and the result is a rich and flavourful pasta unlike any I've had! The scallops and crabmeat were cooked perfectly. Hands-down the favourite dish at our table.

Buckwheat pancakes ($20) - 3.5 stars
Too dry this time - definitely better when we had this at the cafe itself - but still had good flavour. The passionfruit curd and berry compote that came with it had just the right touch of sweetness.

Populus scramble with lobster bisque and crab meat ($22) - 4 stars
My sister wished the croissant could have been packed separately. Decadent scrambled eggs with the lobster bisque and crab meat but eggs only do so much for me. I personally prefer the seafood linguine.

Butter rum banana French toast ($19) - 4 stars
Solid but I'm a dessert alcoholic and thought it could use more rum. Topped with Greek yoghurt.

Tuscan lamb harissa baked eggs ($19) - 4 stars
Had a tiny bit of this. Pretty sweet from the tomatoes. Flavoured well. The ciabatta was a little hard.

Wagyu beef donburi ($18) - 4 stars
A touch too sweet. The toppings (purple cabbage and ginger I believe) were well done as was the Japanese rice. Strong truffle taste. I didn't try the beef though.",72

They do make their own pasta and you can have a taste of their cheese.

Nice wine selection. Great ambiance.

Pistachio Tiramisu did not look too presentable as it was liquidy but taste was good.

For dessert, their sugee cake is served warm. The flavor is classic and texture meant to melt in your mouth.

The service was impeccable. The staffs were always alert and knows their menu very well. We had leftovers of our beef rendang, which was the best meal of the night. Thought that they would throw it out but no, they called us to tell us we left it! So we went back to collect it.

We chose this place because my bf needed an emergency pit stop to the bathroom.  I can't comment on the bathroom facilities because I was a bit afraid to go in there after he was done.  :/

The menu listed a Kopitiam set for only $3.50, yay!  I also saw a beautiful photo of Bah Kuh Teh that we unfortunately didn't get a chance to come back and try for lunch.

Standard Kopitiam breakfast with runny eggs, Singaporian coffee, and kaya butter toast.  Simple decor with a cute old-fashioned look with a mini Singapore coffee museum which was literally just a few ancient artifacts displayed in the back room.

I was excited to let my bf try a wife cake (one of my all-time favs from Taiwan), but I was a bit disappointed at the greasy pastry that ended up before us.  Not sure if this was typical Singaporean style or a rancid leftover, but it was nothing like the light, flaky ones I've had from Taiwan.

We also grabbed some bottles of grass jelly to quench our thirst, and I didn't realize they were mint-flavored.  So that was a bit weird, but still interesting to try something new.",5

I really don't.  I agree with a previous reviewer: Why is every single place in Singapore which serves good tasting, real food combined with good service expensive? Seriously, Singapore: you are raising your children to believe that healthy, locally sourced food is only for the elite? That giving good service and being polite comes at a price?

That being said, I am happy that places as Open Farm Community exist and that I can afford going there now and then. The food is delicious and the service is how it should be. The watercress-kale soup is really good, but for 19$ I expect no less. I do wonder though: the other dish we had was beef rib eye: where do they source cows in Singapore?

To me, Open Farm Community needs to seriously walk the talk. Their website reads that they want to connect the community to nature and  celebrate local spirit. In addition to being on the costly side, their location is not reachable without a car.  In a country where a lot of people do not own a car, this is not really helping to reach the local community.

5 stars for the food & service but 3 stars for a concept mismatch so 4 stars overall.",9

Still, breakfasts looked quite attractive.

I had the eggs benedict while my wife had scrambled eggs on green pesto. Both were good and did the job, but were a bit lackluster. We ended up with an uneasy feeling, that there was something missing. I mean, food tastes good, but is far away from spectacular, and that's when Epicurious starts losing points. There's no ""wow! factor"", nothing that would make us be anxious to go back. The bill just confirmed this uneasy feeling.

Our friends at Epicurious do a good job and are clearly making an effort. Unfortunately, the food ends up being average while prices are not. I wish they can overcome this gap, they surely deserve better.",11

But from those that I have visited so far, Riders Cafe is my favorite. We tried to get a reservation the day before and was told that they were fully booked. They would still accept walk-ins though, and that's what we did. We had to wait for about 30 minutes for our table. Not too bad, considering you can wait in the car until they call you.

I had the poached egg, portobello, sweet corn polenta and it was cooked very nicely. It's a very simple dish but the execution was very good. Another dish that we had was the almond-granola crusted fried chicken. I think the crispness of the almond & granola matches very well as a batter for the fried chicken. I must note that they also served the corn polenta in this dish, too repetitive IMO.

We also ordered the roasted pork belly and it was the letdown of the meal. It was such a sin to cook a pork that way. The skin was hard and not crispy and the meat was just dried out.

I'll definitely go to Riders Cafe to try the other items in their menu again though. I heard that their dinner menu is also good and that's another reason to come back.",4

They have many flavors here--traditional ones and also specials like key lime and carrot cake. They also have mini cupcakes if you want to try to different flavors or cant finish a big one. 

Prices here are ridiculous in my opinion. The small cupcakes which can be finished in literally one bite are $3. If I am going to pay this much for a tiny cupcake, I want it to taste amazing. It was just ok. Honestly, the three times I have tried it it was REALLY dry. Not cool for cupcakes at all.

Well, at least the portion of it sensible enough not to splurge on high tea, I suppose. The tea-related desserts were good! But mains and ice cream flavours were a little hit and miss.

Mains: 
We had scrambled egg with saffron, and foie gras terrine which came with fresh brioche toast. For the egg, you get to choose between three flavours: matcha, saffron, and truffle oil. Matcha+egg sounded a little Dr Seuss so we skipped over that. But I think picking saffron was a mistake, since the saffron flavour didn't come out at all. I was initially skeptical about the foie gras but it turned out to be a winner. The toast was crispy, and soft but not soggy, and the foie gras spread perfectly over it.

Tea:
The selection of tea here really is overwhelming. We zoomed in to the ""exclusive blends"" section of the menu and ended up with something called Snow Mountain Tea, which is white tea. It was light, clear, and refreshing, and went really well with the dessert.

Dessert:
Madeleines with clotted cream and some TWG Tea jelly, and three macarons. I adore the macarons here. Flavours are rich enough and ingredients are fairly decent quality, something I can't say for many other macarons made in SG. The madeleines were also a delight -- fluffy and warm and perfect with the cream and the jelly. I love the jelly so much I wouldn't mind eating it every day. We also had two scoops of ice cream. One was dark pink and tasted of berries, I can't remember its name but it might have been the Timeless. Not memorable, not worth getting. The other was the Napoleon which had macadamias.

But to be honest, calling Lokal a cafe really doesn't do the justice as its food standard is one of the highest in SG. 

Unlike the weekday mornings, the place was PACKED. They had a waiting list of people to be seated around 11:30am. But I was able to grab a seat at the chef's counter and gawk at all the delicious foods that were coming freshly out of the kitchen and enjoy my food. 

I started off with English breakfast tea-- not bad, but nothing exceptional. But I wish there was an option to have the tea set out of the pot as the tea got way too bitter towards the end of my meal. 

Then I had the roasted pumpkin salad  (5/5 )which just AMAZED me. One of the best salad I've had. It's flavorful without being drenched in dressing and just the right heartiness with well-cooked, yet still firm pupkin, healthy mix of quinoa and nuts, and fresh beans. It is definitely a must try.

Then finished the meal with the chef's first attempt at anzac cookies (4/5; Australian traditional cookies--made with coconut and oats) and my gosh. I'm generally not a huge fan of oat cookies, but this sweetness was just right. And for that I had to order a cup of long black (I've come to not call it Americano anymore while in Singapore) to go along. I was told the beans were roasted by Sarnies and the blend was created in-house, and was called fuzzy wuzzy (4.5/5). But boy did they do a good job. The aroma and the finishing note of the coffee well-complemented the cookie.

The afore-mentioned salted egg yolk croissant is all kinds of decadent good. Perhaps a little pricey at $7 but worth the occasional treat. It's a light and flaky pastry with a rich, sweet, and savory salted egg filling that is so unctuous. It's yummy. Note: they do sell out of these so come early. 

I've also had the Dirty Norwegian croissant which is great for a brunch entree. It's the same flaky croissant with smoked salmon, poached eggs, with the same salted egg yolk sauce plus buttered cereal. It's everything great about the salted egg yolk croissant and then leveled up for brunch. Also served with a side salad that I appreciated and chicken sausages that I thought was extraneous and distracting.

I tend to avoid the regular lattes and coffees etc, because they're pretty average here. What I really like are their ""spins"" and ""twists"". 

My favourite would have to be the Strawberry T - Twist which is this icy drink mixed with strawberry bits and black tea - super refreshing! 
I also love the Cookie Spin ... it's a super sweet icy cookie mix but really addictive. For something a little less sweet, I'd suggest the Espresso Spin and Hazlenut Chocolate Spin (I love the nutty bits inside).

A friend once commented that I use full caps in every review I write, and looking back, that's basically true.

Amidst the LUSH greenery of the Rochester area... okay before I go further I have no idea why I typed lush in full caps. It was kinda superfluous wasn't it. It's not like the greenery there is all Botanic Gardens or Bukit Timah Nature Reserve or anything. Definitely didn't need the cap lock.

So amidst the not-so-lush but definitely not sparse vegetation of the Rochester area, is THE nicest Starbucks in Singapore. I believe the one at the Delphi Orchard comes in second, though I will note that I have yet to experience the special Starbucks store near Fullerton. The one that's billed as the 100th Starbucks store in Singapore or something like that? Anyway. This Starbucks. Is. NAAAAAIIIIISEEEEEE. It's like got this colonial aura thing going on with the white wooden and black trim. Even though it's pretty near various schools it's generally not too crowded when you head over in the afternoon, and it's got everything you expect a Starbucks to have.

You have your coffee bagels Wifi overly-sweet-desserty-things students-studying couples-canoodling middle-aged expat working on a laptop... it's EVERYTHING YOU LOVE ABOUT STARBUCKS but somewhere NICE. and AIRY. AND OPEN. 

What's there not to like! 
The only thing I don't get is why they don't open 24 hours or at least till late. It's got this great location. I'd DRIVE there to chill (much like what people do for the Holland Village branch)... SO WHY THEY KEEP CHASING ME OUT SO EARLY. :(

We also didn't get enough peanut sauce for all the satay we ordered.  And since they already had our money the stall owners didn't care.   Which means we won't go back to their stall again.   Bad service had penalties.",3

It looks like this place was recently renovated as the seating is pretty clean and modern looking (marble tables?) and the bathrooms rival those of malls. Not to mention there's an escalator to access the second floor rather than just stairs.

First floor is a market for flowers, goods, produce, meats and etc.

Second floor is the magical food court! On the day I visited there was also a guy singing covers of famous English and Chinese songs which just made the dining experience all that much better.

As I was still stuffed from my early lunch at Maxwell, I only got to try two things here:

Lor Mee: I got the recommended order and added on fried shark nuggets. I mean it's fried shark meat? It was kinda just like eating fish...I couldn't really tell the difference. The gravy that accompanies the noodles is pretty good though. I think you definitely need to come hungry in order to finish a whole bowl by yourself as the gravy is pretty heavy.

MJ drink: wow who knew grass jelly and soy milk went so well together?! Why was this combination not in my life till now! And it's soo cheap too! I would get this all the time if I lived near here! I'm so glad I managed to get here about half an hour before they close shop for the day.

I really really wanted to try the prawn mee by the escalators (looked like it was good as there was a line) but my stomach said there was no more space so next time for sure!",3

They provides fruit and veggie juices with ingredients that are hard to come by in many healthy restaurants I've been to. They have juices with coconut water, goji berries, cilantro, wheatgrass, etc., but they also add supplements to some of their juices like Vitamineral green, lecithin, maca powder, etc. Their smoothies and shakes are vegan, made with nut or rice milk, a refreshing change if you want to cut dairy out of your diet. 

The food menu, however, is not 100% vegetarian. They have chicken and fish on the menu from what I remember. The night I went, I had the TLC roll and the TLC Cheeseburger, both of which are vegetarian. The roll did have homemade mayo so I'm not sure if its totally vegan, but the quality of the ingredients are definitely very good. The price sort of matches that, reasonable. I paid $40 for a fruit and veggie juice, a roll, the cheeseburger and a vegan/gluten free chocolate cake.

This place also sells supplements, tools to make things at home like a nut milk bag, mason jars and the like, as well as ingredients like salt, vanilla extract, palm sugar, etc. Not gunna lie though, those items were expensive and I know that I can get these same items for cheaper back in the states or even in other shops in Singapore.",3

Located on Bukit Timah and 5th Avenue, I'd be here day after day if it weren't so far and out of the way from where I lived. 

As I try to get away from the plethora of oil laden carb heavy hawker food and onto the raw foods wagon, I start to realise how much Singapore is lacking in it's healthy, organic, gluten/dairy/refined sugars free cafes. In fact, if I'm not wrong, The Living Cafe is the only of it's kind so far here in Singapore (if someone knows of another raw cafe, please let me know!)

The Living Cafe specializes in food that nourishes your body, from the inside out. Most of their menu is raw (meaning, they are all raw vegan foods that have not been heated above 115 degrees fahrenheit in order to preserve it's nutrients). I know, sounds like they'd only serve salads, correct? Wrong. 

My favorites on the menu include their Zucchini Pesto Pasta (note: this isn't actually pasta but zucchini shredded to look like spaghetti and pesto sauce homemade uses herbs and nuts), their Raw Lasagne, Raw Vegetable soups (cold - perfect for a hot day), their Living Rolls (rice paper rolls), Tofu Avocado Rolls, Raw Zucchini Dip (with Flaxseed crackers to dip) and not forgetting their AMAZING AMAZING raw/gluten/refined sugar free desserts. Honestly, the desserts in itself make a trip down here worth it (imagine tiramisu that actually tastes like tiramisu but made solely out of coconut, dates, nuts and other whole ingredients that give you a sugar fix WITHOUT the sugar high)

I love raw foods for it's long term benefits as well as for how good it makes me feel right away, however, making raw foods is truly an art and without the proper knowledge and creative skills, you'd end up eating salads everyday. The Living Cafe truly makes it easy to eat raw from time and time with their creativeness and amazing sauces that liven up otherwise tasteless vegetables. 

On top of that, service is very friendly and the space is nice (nice enough to sit all day with a book) with a small area for your kids to play while you enjoy lunch too. 

My advice? Go for lunch (they close for dinner), get dessert and take a look at their little store upstairs after (they sell things like the Vitamix, Raw Cacao, Chia Seeds, the Zucchini Pasta maker and much more!)",4

The menu is updated frequently and so someone who comes here often (like me) am always greeted with different things, which is another plus.
I like all their salads - tuna, tataki and tofu are my top 3 picks. 
Their seafood alio olio pasta is another dish I would recommend.

If you're a member you get 15% discount and earn points that you can rebate, so per person it costs around $30 to dine here (food and drink).",7

They're all around Singapore, and almost everyone knows them.

But I agree with @Mervin L. who wrote the earlier review, this Ya Kun is just different, and one of my favourite branches. So it warrants a review on its own :)

I am such a local 'Teh' kind of girl, and these are the reasons why this Ya Kun is special:

- Orchard Central, for some reason, is much less crowded than most parts of Orchard, making it a haven to chill and unwind (even work on your laptop - if you have a USB dongle), especially on a weekday/weeknight

- This Ya Kun has full-length windows, lots of natural light, beautiful whimsical drawings on the walls, and a very comfortable relaxed ambience

- In fact, it's so nicely setup that they even offer rental space for private and corporate events within their premise

- Quiet, quiet, quiet (unless there are some stage performances going on downstairs), the Ya Kun to go to for some peace and tranquility

- Choice of in-store or corridor seating (I usually take the latter, more privacy)

- One of the few select branches where Ya Kun pilots newer menu items, e.g. fried toast cubes, kaya balls, toast sticks etc.

- It's right next to NIKS Shop Salon, which happens to be where I stock up my supply of skincare products, so....",4

Oh, and rice too if you prefer that.

The star is undoubtedly the char siew, closely followed by the siu yok. The char siew is a delicious combination of fat, lean meat and charred exterior that really hits the spot. You will probably end up with a couple of slices of char siew that are all fat and you can ignore them because really, a little fat goes a long way. If you're really squeamish about the amount of fat on your meat, you can request for leaner portions.

Place your order at the stall with whomever's holding a notepad (usually a lady) and choose between the warm and humid coffee shop interior or the hot and warm-airy outside. Either way, you're going to have to wait if the tables are filled because the food takes a while to get to your table. Going in the evening makes for a more comfortable dining experience but don't dawdle because they close at 8pm.

Get your green chilli and chilli sauce yourself from the side of the stall. The chilli sauce is provides a nice acidic and spicy kick and goes perfect with the meats. Drinks and ice are also self-service from the fridges and are at a standard price of $1 per can.",3

I particularly like this outlet as although sometimes the queue can be pretty long, like all other koi outlets who put service as their priority, the staff would come out of the counter to take orders. 

Even if the staff doesn't do that, the queue still manages to clear quite fast and customers just have to wait a maximum of 10minutes or less to get a thirst quenching drink. I have been to other outlets and the queue is long too but the waiting time can go up to 20-30 minutes which is madness. 

I like their variety of drinks and coffees, and particularly the bubble milk tea which is the most basic drink there. The tea just tastes so natural and once you try the tea from this stall you wouldn't want to buy any other bubble tea from other stall cause they just don't taste that good anymore. The yakult green tea and black tea macchiato are also must tries.",12

I almost took a taxi there but decided to use the MRT instead because it was about a 21 min drive from Lavender. So during our first day in Singapore I dragged Hubby along for a joyride to Riviera LRT. Don't worry, we had never even heard about the LRT line before today but the café was within 5 minutes walking distance from the LRT.

Whisk and Paddle was a popular choice for cyclist and families especially since it was a bit of a mini getaway place from the always busy city. I think a lot of people appreciate the change of scenery that they could find within the small area. 

Service was really good and the staff was quite attentive as every customer were given glasses of cold water right as they sat down. There was a small kids' corner where little boys and girls can enjoy some activities using toys provided by the café. If you can't bear the humidity, there is also indoor seating available for customers.

One important tip: as soon as you get off the Riviera LRT, take a lift / stair down and use your google maps to locate the Punggol Police Station. Once you've found the police station, there's a restaurant complex nearby (Popeye's Chicken, Seafood restaurant etc and you will see the Whisk and Paddle café soon enough).

FOOD
The humid weather made hubby crave cold drinks more than usual so he ordered a glass of yellow mango smoothie. I went with the black sesame latte instead, a drink that will certainly make a person conscious of having black sesame powder stuck on their teeth after a few sips. I like my black sesame latte since it wasn't too strong and it came with pretty coffee art too.

We tried the Pandan Melaka waffle that came with Movenpick Vanilla Dream ice cream, cubic butter cakes, roasted cashew, gula Melaka and bits of cornflakes. Today's waffle was crispy and it had a really good texture. The Madagascar vanilla icecream didn't disappoint too and to be honest it was probably the best vanilla ice cream that I ever tasted! Every material worked well together and also perfect to be shared between two people. Next time I will request an extra bowl of gula Melaka ;-).",3

There are tons of cat, and all of them for the most part are pretty well behaved. The patrons on the other hand were not.  I kid you not... there was a grown man who went around annoying all the cats and made the staff take pictures of him posing. It was pretty ridiculous.  He even changed his shirt at one point... in front of me. Annoying and inappropriate but whatever. None of the cats liked him.

I had the chocolate Earl Grey tea. It was damn nice. I loved it. 
It smelled and tasted of chocolate and tea.
The only horrible thing was they only served 1 pot and the cups were too dainty.
Give it to me in a beer mug and a barrel of tea , i SAY!

Food..i had some foie gras salad thing and chicken.
I'm sorry if i can't give you the exact details. 10.30pm was way past my bedtime and they don't seem to serve coffee.

Chicken was meh. it was alright. tasted like chicken. I've had better chicken elsewhere.

Two Men Bagel is an obvious choice for bagel lovers and you can see from the queue that it's made up of a lot of homesick westerners. 

The bagels are no where near as massive as in New York and it doesn't have that sheen to it, but then again, they don't have the water. The sandwiches are inventive, bordering on too ambitious. Because the bagels themselves aren't that large, the filling often falls out, leaving your hands a mess. 

Like all foreign foods swept far from their homeland, it's more expensive (especially the drinks, my God it's robbery) and not as good, but it's all we have.

I would recommend their chocolate croissants as those are the only products from bread society that has not failed to disappoint time and time again.

It was so good I had it after lunch and after dinner on the same day. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. 

Flavors I tried that was incredible : pistachio( my favorite!) Ferrero Roche, black sesame, strawberry ( they roast the strawberries before making it for the intense fresh strawberry flavor)! And oh yes, speculoos cheesecake!!!

I swept sweet bakes like Vanilla & Raisin Swirl $3.50 & Orange Brioche off the shelve, and the former wins slightly but with low marks. The Danish presented in burnt rims, has a notable buttery flavor but not rich enough to remember. The sweet glaze blend gently with the flaky pastry partnering some scattered candies raisins. I wasn't really impressed with the taste, just mediocre.

The Orange Brioche $5.00, was weaker in taste. It didn't sing any buttery tune like other artisanal brioche, no signs of flakiness and rather dry in its texture. There was a small helping of citrus scented custard piped in the middle of the dough, mildly sweet. The orange fruit slice hindered my chewing - simply aesthetically pleasing on the the sweet bread.

The Madeleine $2.00/pc, was a decent piece. Not exceedingly sweet with a soft interior. I'd prefer it to be served warm like db Moderne Bistro so that I could taste the rich buttery structure in its comforting warmth. This one was left in the open, atop the pastry glass cabinet, side-by-side the Financiers. Obviously, it has been overpriced.

The Kumara & Bleu Tart $6.00/pc, champ the fleet in my whole selection when its rivals failed to compete well. The soft and crumbly tart shell adapted quite well to the sweet orange-pigmented kumara cubes gelled together in a pool of coagulated cheese - buttery rich and very delightful. Noticeable flavor is seen coming from the flaky tart, less from the filling.

The battle field continues to be less interesting when the limping Roast Chicken Sandwich $11.50, hit the ground. The fillet slices were dry and fibrous, no traces of flavor until my taste buds met up with the sweet onion chutney above the fresh lettuce. The hard-like-rock baguette made things worst, it was a total shame!

When I thought nothing will be praised, I was charmed by the healthier fare, $8.50 - Quinoa & Lentil Salads. The power grains are executed in perfection along with a mixture of soft lentil which is often undercooked. Carefully seasoned with the right amount of tang lending from the balsamic reduction and some sweet hints from the fresh apple slices, the rehydrated dried cranberry fruits, the heap of rocket greens woke my taste buds with a striking saltiness from the accompanying shaven Parmesan. Just as the episode starts to climax, I felt a cold gush of water came splashing down - the 2 sesame rolls that served alongside was rockier & rubbery than the earlier baguette! What's happening to the breads here? I let out a heavy sigh!",12

The company, of course, was superb. The food was really good, but the menu was really tough if you're trying to follow the Paleo lifestyle. Hubby order the roasted wagyu rump with ratte potatoes, poached eggs, red onions, chili bearnaise and brioche bun. Because of the quantity of food, he ended up eating the bread to fill up. I got the eggs benedict with poached chicken, spinach, semi-dried tomatoes, and green curry hollandaise sauce. I had them sub the sourdough for more spinach. I left hungry. Again, the food was awesome, but didn't fit Paleo and portions were on the small side, so this place gets a 3.5/5 for me. 

I really did love the setting and the style of food they prepare, and would like to try my luck with their lunch or dinner menu. It's still on my to do list and I promise to update this review once I've given those two menus a shot. 

Ultimately, go. Try. Enjoy. :)",7

Obviously I am not from the era so I cannot judge if the food is a good representation of that period but overall, I do like the food. Kaya toast is kaya spread & butter sandwiched in two thin slices of toasted white bread. Kaya is a green  or brown paste ( the color depends if yours had panada leaves in it) made out of thicken coconut milk and sugar, reduced into a paste. So yes, it is extremely bad for your health to consume this in huge quantities, especially since it goes together with thick slabs of butter. But, the warm melty goodness is worth it",4

But what drew me into the store was the huge, white EK43 lurking in the corner that signaled the potential for a good pourover. Peeking behind the counter, portafilters locked tight into the group head are always a good sign of a café that knows its shit. 

Ambience is bright and airy, despite the tight confines of the unit, and the staff are friendly and welcoming. 

So, coffee. It's certainly a step up from the other coffee outlets in the building. They do a tasty cold brew (also done in store), and espresso beverages are well-pulled. 

But of course any self respecting coffeenista will want to know what their hand brew is like. They brew with a Clever at 88 deg C, for about 3 mins. Have tried their Ethiopian and Kenyan beans, and found their hand brew to be a bit over extracted - nonetheless, still tastier than the competition. 

Still, it's early days and I reckon I'll drop by often since its in my patch. Staff were open to my feedback on the grind size, so I'm looking forward to some variety in their pourover.",9

I braved the long queue and waited over an hour to partake in, what I expected to be a bowl of yumminess. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment! 

Lor Mee- served with noodles and a generous topping of fish and other ingredients. The gravy was significantly rich and thick with a slightly gelatinous texture and predominantly tasted of fish. It's definitely an acquired taste. Not something I'd get again. 

Despite the rave reviews of Lor Mee, the unsung hero is the Minced Mixed Noodle IMO. Pork dumplings and minced pork swimming in a bowl of wide rice noodles. The broth was light and full of flavors with the fresh herbs adding brightness to this delicious dish. A must try! 

Char Kway Teow noodles and proteins were impeccably cooked with a beautifully smoky charred flavor however, it was well under seasoned and one noted. Perhaps a dash of soy sauce will help lift the flavors a bit or it was an off day for the stall. Overall it wasn't a bad dish. 

Fried prawn and pork rolls were a mixed of sweet and savory flavors. While it wasn't my favorite, it was a nice side dish. 

Curry Chicken and Black Pepper Pork Puffs had a flaky crispy crusts and loaded with herbs and spices. A great snack especially on the go.

Let alone, listen to them. You can sell five star stuff but if you do not have a shred of decency you don't deserve five stars. 

Others who have reviewed have talked about their terrible attitude going way back a few years. I can imagine that this was not a one-off thing or the recipient of someone's bad day. It is ingrained.",4

For the unfamiliar, you would probably not know Rich & Good Cakes, which is tucked along one of the streets near Arab Street.

Typically you get tapas bites and 1 for 1 offers, great for big groups and intimate gathering for beers! Had their luncheon meat fries and they were fried beautifully with a serving of nancho cheese chips.

They have dart machines in the bar as well so dart fanatics, dart your night away.

Lola's Café has only been around for about 3 months, it surely added more liveliness to the area. This vintage café is also easily accessible - it takes you less than 5 minutes to walk from Kovan MRT (the exit opposite Heartland Mall).

This café is set up by 2 young entrepreneurs, Choo Kiat and June. Besides being the boss, Choo Kiat is the chef cum barista. On the other hand, June is responsible for the pastries that you see in the café. By the way, 'Lola' is actually June's middle name.

This small and quaint café is filled with a variety of vintage furniture and mood lightings. I was particularly attracted to their tables - they are all made from our traditional sewing machines! Furthermore, most of the vintage furniture here are for sale - Do check them out if you'll like to add a bit of character to your room! 

The most unique part of the cafe is their beer menu consists of a good variety of carefully drafted beers from boutique breweries in US, UK and Belgium. 

I went for their Matcha Latte which costs $5.00. The latte was pretty smooth and had a sweet aftertaste. It's a little sweeter over here compared to other cafes, you might want to ask for less sugar. I also tried their Banana Earl Grey Tart ($4.00) which is one of their specialties. It's topped with a layer of sugar and pistachio nuts which tastes very crunchy. The Earl Grey paste was a little too moist though.

My favourite was their Wasabi White Chocolate Mousse ($7.00). Never would I have expected wasabi to go well with white chocolate! An exotic mix of ingredients, it's a surprising recipe and very delicious! Don't worry about the spiciness of the wasabi; it's very gentle and not too overwhelming. The sweetness of the white chocolate complements the overall taste and it melts in your mouth! It's so unique I can't describe it with words. You have to try it for yourself!

Lola's cafe is very conducive for reading and for studying. You could also reward yourselves with some savoury desserts while working your brain cells! It's also a good place to hang out with your friends in the late evenings over some beer and honey wings. Service was great, staff were all very friendly. I will certainly come back again to try out their brunch and beers!

P.S: This cafe is free of GST and Service Charge!",3

Let's start with the good...
1. The space is great and you can't deny the wow factor as soon as you walk in the door
2. The coffee is decent

Ok now on to my experience... firstly, this place is pricey. Think Sydney prices, which would be acceptable if we lived in Sydney (and even then I don't think the food is of the same quality). Secondly, I ordered a takeaway flat white here once before, but I may as well have sat in because no one served me until I looked for a waitress (there were people behind the counter but completely distracted) and then it took 15 minutes for a take away coffee? What the.

I could have let this all go IF I'd had a good food experience.

But I didn't.

One hungover Sunday I thought the burger would be a good idea. It was actually a very bad idea given the burger that turned up on my plate was RAW. Not rare, but raw. I sliced through the middle of my burger, super excited to have that first big messy bite but the inside was cold and, I'll say it again, raw. I had to fight a reflex retch motion... 

Slightly embarassed (as was dining with 'new friends'), I waved down a waiter who took it back to the kitchen to be re-cooked (no apology?). In the meantime, my dining companions all finished their meals, I filled up on the fries, and I then had to conspicuously eat my returned burger (where both halves of the meat patty had been recooked and reserved) in front of everyone... my appetite was well and truly over and  I wouldn't have even finished half of it - not an ideal outcome especially given the burger is a steep $28!

When paying the bill, I was asked how the meal was? Of course I gave my opinion (tactfully of course) but was told the burger is usually served medium... if that was the case, why was I not given a refund? With juice and coffee, the bill added up to $44 per person (insert ""whistle noise"" here). 

OK rant over, I'll just vote with my feet next time and suggest elsewhere.",6

Great pizza ( we ummed and ahhed but eventually opted for the bolognaise with a side of chilli- excellent!...)

Now wouldn't it be great if we could just offset the cheesey/carby/oily middle aged pizza angst/guilt with a fresh salad? We can? Double brilliant!!!

Their specialty is the Mongolian pork rib which is heavenly. The ribs are not cut into small cubes and there are still huge chunks of meat stuck to it. Perhaps it's not favourable for dainty ladies that will be paiseh to hold up the bones and rip the meat off; I have no qualms for that =D  The ribs has a very unique taste; creamy, peppery and there's a hint of mint. The sauce is very appetising and I can finish my whole of rice just with the sauce alone. The rib if always cooked till tender but not too soft till it just falls off the bone. 

Another house special will be the signature tofu. If I guess it correctly, it's normal tofu smashed with other condiments like onions+ carrot + minced meat, then being re-shaped into a cube and deep fried. Sounds like a perfectly simple dish yet tastes awesome. They are served with some fresh cabbage and mayo on the side. 

The rib and tofu is my ""must-order"" dishes. Other common zhi char dishes are very good too; sambal kangkong, fu rong egg, pai gu wang. 

The next time you are around Bugis but looking for a non-shopping-mall-food-chain-place, you should definitely try 3838. Highly recommended!",8

This was it. In an understated cafe in Clarke quay's The Central mall. 

A bit hard to find but I managed to do it without a sweat. 

The classic tiramisu is your best bet. Perfectly moist and not too sweet, light on the palette but just the right amount of cream.

I didn't really enjoy the matcha version as it was too bitter for me, though pure matcha lovers might enjoy it.

Honestly, I felt the price was okay and justifiable plus the size of the cake just nice to satisfy, especially since Starbucks is able to get away with selling their subpar cakes for the same price.

I find that it's a little low profile on the shop front, which might mislead some passerby to imagine it as just another meat store. However, they have an interesting concept here!

In the store, you can choose the type of meat you'd like to go for, and the expert will do the cut and serve it hot for dine in with a extra handling fee of $8 which comes with 2 side dishes. The people in store definitely know their stuff, so I can trust them on the food delivered. You can also purchase wine and other beverages here. For lunch, they serve gourmet sandwiches as well with coffee/tea. Desserts are also available in their fridge.

First visit and I had an Aussie 90 days grainfed ribeye stinky $4/100g!!! DAMN SHIOK AH. I returned subsequently a couple of times to bring my colleagues for meals too. Go early for lunch as there's really limited seats inside (just 1 counter top if I remember correctly).

So yes, this is a also a fresh meat supplier store. For days when we require meat for parties, I'll get the whole slab of good quality meat back home to serve. The price is reasonable and you can be guaranteed on the quality! The frozen section sells frozen USDA meat and seafood as well, which I rarely check them out.

Give me quality meat at low cost and I'm a happy customer!!",6

Conveniently located in Chinatown, this is a great place to stop by for a bite to eat after you're done with souvenir shopping / exploration in Chinatown. For the food, simply go to the second floor, and bam! You'll be greeted with food stalls upon food stalls and the delicious smell of various food wafting around.

As a tourist, I was pretty overwhelmed at what to eat and where to start. My suggestion to anyone who hasn't been to a hawker center before is to walk around first and observe the food prior to just jumping to a stall and ordering right away. Since the place was quite big, it did take some time for my friends and me to explore the different food stalls and making mental notes at which ones we wanted to try. Best plan when traveling with a group of people is to pick a general eating spot, split up, get whatever food you desire, and regroup at the eating area. The eating area itself is scattered around with tables and chairs. 

For the food stalls, there was a huge variety that ranged from only fresh fruit smoothies / drinks to various cuisines like Chinese, Indian, Singaporean, Indonesian and etc. If you need food suggestions, simply go line up for food stalls that have huge lines. Most likely, these food stalls are either popular with locals/tourists, or the food is pretty cheap and tasty. I used this tactic and ended up with delicious food that I at first, had no idea what I was eating. 

For food here, I highly recommend lining up for the Food Street Fried Kway Teow Mee. Simply put, it's noodles mixed with a spicy like sauce, seafood like taste and such. Not sure what else goes into it, but it is one tasty dish!! To find this stall, look for a long line (or at my picture). The wait is definitely worth it and it's cool to see the chef in action on making your meal. As for drinks, pretty much most of the drinks stalls have similar prices (price average around $1-3). As for another random dish I tried, the green bean rice dumping at the Jia Ji Mei Shi food stall was amazingly good. With its sticky rice texture on the outside, and the green bean taste mixed in with the meat and rice......man, this was so yummy and at the same, mad filling on the tummy. If you do order this dish, I highly recommend getting the sweet and spicy chili sauce with it. So good. 

Overall, prices for most food stalls is pretty cheap (with a few exceptions on higher end seafood dishes) and you do get the option of picking your portion sizes that range from small to large. I spent roughly $5 that landed me 2 food items + 2 drinks and that alone made me go into a food coma. Make sure you bring cash since most places don't take credit cards.

After eating, I recommend checking out the first floor where it's like a mini clothing market that sells various clothes and small trinkets :)",3

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

$19.00 for brioche french toast was pricey, but very much on par with other spots catering to tourists and expats like Clinton Street and Common Man. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

I don't know how they do it and especially how they maintain consistency internationally, but these fluffy cakes of goodness are so flavorful and go so well with the blueberries and maple butter syrup that it's just impossible to compete.

The idea of farm to table is what drew me to this place but I doubt if even 10% of the food served come from their farm. 

Brunch for 2 on a sunday: buttermilk pancakes, ocean trout crepe, Caesar salad (shared) and lemon tart with basil ice cream (shared). Total bill 110 sgd. Pricey, and that's without any drinks at all.

The food was ok in general. I recommend the lemon tart, with delicious basil ice cream. The ocean trout crepe was good, with quality ingredients. Pancakes were so-so. Caesar salad serving style was novel but taste was average.",9

First off, if you're planning a visit here for a meal, do yourselves a favor and book a reservation beforehand. If you love eating outside and beautiful views of Singapore; make sure that reservation is outside. The views at this place are spectacular! Some of the best in the city. Now, the food is in my honest opinion, nothing to write home about. I've had a few different things off the menu and nothing ever knocked me off my feet. Last night, my wife took me here for my birthday dinner, I had the truffle linguine, she had the brewery burger. For sides we shared the roasted potatoes and the mushroom dish. The potatoes were cooked well, but were mostly bland and flavorless. The mushrooms had some taste, but still quite bland for my tastebuds. The linguine was excellent, a perfect portion that paired well with my IPA. Do not forget that this place is a Brewery, so have a beer. Leave the wine for other restaurants!

All in all, the restaurant gets a 3 for food and a 5 for the views and the atmosphere.",5

Why does it get high marks from the Nings?  Cleanliness, community feel and flow of space.  

The place is super clean and seems cleaner than any other hawker center we have been too.  It is off the beaten path a bit from touristy spots and has that community feel to it (although easily reached via subway and then a 5-10 minute walk).  The center area of the hawker center is open and thus a bit more breezy, if you are lucky to have a day that is breezy.  

When we were here a few weeks ago, we enjoyed many dishes, but the Laksa at stall #50 was my personal favorite.  We both commented that this would be the hawker center we would bring future visitors too, for the cleanliness and flow make it a nicer experience for the uninitiated to absorb.",9

Yes, you heard me right -- all-you-can-eat.  I totally understand that I'm playing the tourist when I come here. But you know what, I do it anyway. I think it would also be a great place to bring out-of-town guests. 

They open at 8pm, making it sound like a dessert place, but don't be fooled. Here's some advice. Don't eat dinner! Come hungry so you can try all the different cakes, cookies, fondue, tarts, ice cream, hot chocolate and more that they have to offer. Trust me, if you eat anything before you come, you're just not going to make it through. 

The dessert here is very good. I'm not going to say that it's amazing or mind-blowing, because it's not. But it's very good. There is a passionfruit and chocolate cake there that I'm crazy about though. Not everything is pure chocolate. Everything does has something chocolate in it though, even if it's just garnish. So there are many fruity things, light things, and very different things. This actually makes it nice because, realistically, how much chocolate could you really eat? There are so many choices of dessert, good luck trying everything. Don't miss the fondue with the homemade marshmallows. 

Coffee and hot chocolate is included and you can pay for cocktails. 

Unfortunately, there are no tables in this place that has a view off the front of the hotel. There is outdoor seating, but it faces the back, and so not over the city, Marina Bay and the pool. But, being able to get up to the pool is pretty great. And you should definitely walk around up there before or after your sugar overdose. Don't tell the staff at the restaurant that though, because they will tell you that you have to straight back down, and that walking around is not allowed -- just do it, and no one will bother you.",3

The food was served within 15 minutes of waiting. The katsu was cooled down when served. Texture wise, it is as crunchy and tender as it looks but would prefer it to be served warmer. The curry had potatoes and beef in it and as I was pouring on my don (rice), it still had the steaming effect. For the lunch set, it will come with salad and a small slice of watermelon. For this dish, I would gladly give a 4 stars.

The second time visiting this place was on a Saturday during tea break (around 2pm). Decided to give the Yuzu Snow cake a try. The Yuzu was strong and the jelly square bits on the top made it more chewy. According to my friend, it was refreshing.

I also managed to take a spoonful of my friend's matcha cake. There were too much cream in the middle that the taste of matcha was rather mild. It was soft and light. But for a friend with little tolerance of sweet desserts, she claimed that it was just right for her tastebuds.

Ambience here is pretty cosy. Depending on the crowd, you can chose an indoor or outdoor (open space) seatings. I prefer the outdoor seating as you can see how they drip the coffees too and also good spot to observe people.

How Swedish can it be? Well the decor inside is very Ikea-ish and they do have a lot of Swedish dishes like meatballs (halal, obviously), pytt i panna and many other dishes that were on the menu. Since we weren't feeling like eating Swedish dishes in Singapore (hello, laksa!), we came here just to get refreshments and shade from the harsh Singaporean sun.

Boyfriend ordered (Swedish) coffee while I got myself a lingonberry-ade that was surprisingly fresh and nice (a little bit sour). We shared an earl gray cake, although there was prinsesstårta in the cake shelf.  

Overall, it's a nice ambiance, maybe for Singaporeans who want to try out Swedish stuff, or for the Swedes who miss food from home, but as for me, it's just another concept cafe that is currently trending in Southeast Asia",3

Unfortunately it was after a visit to Katz (and if you've seen the size of their pastrami sandwiches you'd know how stuffed I was at that time) so all I had was the bacon and it didn't leave much of an impression then.

FAST FORWARD TO 5 YEARS LATER! And Clinton Street Baking Co is now in SUNNY (hazy) SINGAPORE!

They don't take reservations, and we were here on a sunday morning, and the queue was 1.5 hours. By the time it was our turn to be seated it was 2 hours. Be warned that the queue is deceptively short because everyone just gives their handphone number and goes away while waiting. There are some red benches to sit on outside the shop but it could fit a maximum of 8 people. 2 yummy mummy-types tried to cut the queue (""why don't we tell them that we have a baby?""). To which I said. ""IS THE BABY GOING TO BE EATING THE FOOD HERE???"")

My question was answered when I made the mistake of ordering the cheese grits. A mush in a plate, it tasted as good as it looked. Which was not at all. I'd rather some mashed potatoes. Even the powdered ones that you get from 7-11.

Other sides were good but not impressive. We had the southern chicken (skin was yums), the scrambled eggs with salmon (not baaaaad), and some farmer's platter. Like, good but I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes for them.

BUT THE STANDOUT WERE THE PANCAKES. 3 flavors - blueberry, banana, chocolate - to choose from. You can add 1 more flavour for $2. Same pancakes, different toppings. These were nice and fluffy and thick yet light. I think the only other place in Singapore that comes close so far is Skyve. If you put the pancakes from those 2 places together and made me choose 1, I don't know which would win. But maybe Clinton Street because of that wonderful maple syrup/butter mix, which married the taste of maple syrup with the smoothness of melted butter.

Come here! Unless you're a yummy mummy with a baby trying to cut the queue -_-""",9

The dishes, unfortunately, are a hit or miss. Some are really very good, like the seafood tom yum risotto, the slipper lobster sandwich and the waffles, especially with the salted caramel ice cream. The tom yum flavor blended surprisingly well with the creaminess of the risotto, and the generous portion of lobster with mentaiko was decadent and tasty. Others, just lack a little bit of flavor or oomph. The bacon chowder and seafood broth is chock full of flavor, but the consistency of the chowder is  a little chalky, and the sous vide salmon in the broth is a little too briny for my liking. The matcha rice with beef was disappointing, with meagre serving of beef which was too dry despite being one of the more expensive items on the menu ($30.90). The prawn aglio olio and carbonara lack flavor as a whole, and the sweet corn risotto was a tad too sweet, which was the same issue with the chilli crab spaghetti. 4 stars if you are wise with what you pick, 2 stars if you are not.",3

I had the fish tacos and a hot chocolate with soy milk. My companion had the big breakfast and a cappuccino. My fish tacos came with salad and curly fries, which I really liked, and wiped out. The tacos themselves were okay, with fish and a mango salsa, and a very crunchy taco. I do wish they had a cream element within to balance the flavors, but all in all, I wasn't disappointed. My hot choc wasn't overly sweet, and still frothy despite the soy. Yum. 

While the prices are on the high side because of its location, it is still cheaper than it's upstairs neighbor, and offers non-brekkie options for you!

Went on a Friday and surprisingly full in the late night. 

Many were here for the pretty rainbow cakes with assorted creams. Today is the oreo and salted caramel cream. The former is a little dry and the latter a bit too caramel sweet. But its a decent rainbow cake. not overly creamy and the colors of the layers are impressively bright. Not the best rainbow cake I ate (as of now i have tried like A LOT of them) but its up there with a couple of my faves.

Savories - sweet potato fries were well done. could have a little more powdered sugar. Truffle Parmesan Fries - alright. The half and half pizza is served in its rectangular form and the crust is thin and filled with herbs (think foccacia bread). an interesting take with the pepperoni and mushroom
with arugula. Overall not a bad pizza. The crust saved the dish.

Drinks - as a coffee and chocolate lover I went for the latte which is small and decent (my girlies beg to differ, so you guys try it and let me know). I was attracted to the chocolate drinks especially with african red hot chocolate and chilli hot chocolate in the list. so we ordered them. THEY WERE NOT HOT. Lukewarm at best. *sad face. But the chilli chocolate had that spicy punch after a sip. so that was the saving grace of that. The african red chocolate had nothing to rescue it from its sad lukewarm (and by now cold) state. *sigh

 The service staff are friendly and one was really honest to let me and my girlies know it was her first day. Not very proactive but attentive when called. So overall not bad. a very young team of girls.

For an estate like Macpherson to have such a cafe really brings a twist to the feel of the place. Will come back again to try the other things like their mains, all day breakkies (weekends only hor) and their non cake desserts. Oh they have interesting cheesecakes too. 

Overall a very good cafe with quality food and a passionate service team. Come here before it gets popular!",7

I would rate it as the best hawker center in Singapore.  Of course there are other good hawker centers and we can debate endlessly which serves the best chicken rice or prawn mee or popiah but the reason I love Amoy Street Food Centre is the diversity and sheer range of options it offers.  I feel truly blessed to be working in its 5 min radius and so spoiled too!

For S$5.50 you can get a big bowl of salad (from any of the 4 - 5 salad shops operating there) when the same bowl of greens can easily cost you 15 or more in the fancy cafes around telok ayer and raffles place.  Or if you want something different you can go for costa rican chicken rice with tacos.  It was here I tried my first ""lei cha"" - the Hakka ""thunder tea"" which is another healthy choice apart from salad.  ""Noodle story"" seems to be another recent favorites judging from the line.  And then of course there are the stars of the show - the famous piao ji and han kee fish soup / fish porridge. Lines are quite formidable every day from 11 am to 2 pm so pick your time wisely if you want to try.  Fancy some dessert after your meal? There is Koko Icecream - the popular coconut icecream served in a real coconut.  Or you can venture to the second floor for some baked goodies at Bake-of Muffins at very reasonable price. There are also fruit juices stalls aplenty so take your pick.  If what you crave is Japanese, Thai or Korea they have it too! It's probably the most international hawker center and the food options itself is a reflection of the changing demographics in Singapore so definitely a great place for people watching as well!",9

The smoke duck is wrap within the omelette and it's placed above the toast with alittle veg & marmalade garnish on top of it and the sides dish is 2 roasted tomatoes and mushroom.

Head Barista and Assistant Manager is John Ting, who came in 2nd at the Singapore National Barista Championship. That's right, Oriole has the two best baristas in Singapore, and it shows! If I were still living in Singapore, I think it's safe to say that this would be my favourite coffee hang-out. In fact, I've been here three times in two weeks.

 Coffee prices here are just a little more expensive than the chains before factoring in service charge, but it's well worth the extra money. The staff pick their coffee with care, as Ï witnessed when I swung by yesterday, with a helpful chap talking me through the beans they used when I wandered over to the giant coffee roaster (named Ella, so I've read). He also mentioned that they were expecting some really nice coffees in a couple of days time so I should return. I will definitely do that, even though I don't own an espresso machine (yet) and only have a Bialetti.

 The best drinks to have here are the piccolo latte (comes with two shots), the chilii chocolate mocha and the citrus sin! The last two are drinks created by Keith for the World Barista Championship, and both were really nice indeed. For the chili chocolate mocha, I couldn't taste too much of the coffee, but it wasn't overwhelmingly chocolate-y either. It was a tad smokey (which I liked) and the flavour of the chili got stronger as I drank more of the beverage, but not enough to kill this chili weakling. As for the citrus sin, it was absolutely fantastic. It comes with a slice of orange so that you can squeeze the juice of it if the drink isn't citrus-y enough for you. I didn't taste very much of the citrus, but it was very smooth, and by far one of the most delicious coffees I've ever had. Two thumbs up!

 The latte art has been of a generally high standard, and I was only disappointed once, when my friend's piccolo latte came with three somewhat splotchy white patches. Possibly, they could have been three separate flowers, but, to me, they looked... messy.

 But enough about the coffee. What about the rest?

 The food was so-so, to be honest. I have had a set lunch consisting of crab and corn soup and a spaghetti bolognese, and a prawn aglio olio. All the dishes were decent, nothing much to complain about, or shout about.

 The cafe is very cosy. It's fairly dark in here, and tables are generally well-spaced so you never feel as if you're being crowded even when the place is full. I like the lighting fixtures for some reason. Very modern without being too showy. The ceiling with the exposed piping toughens the place up a little so it doesn't look pretentious.

 So, if you haven't already been able to tell, I love this place. I will do my best to return before I go back to London, even though I have several other coffee places on my list to check out. And given its late opening hours, I don't think it'll be too hard for me to do so!",3

From Lavender MRT station, the walk takes around 10 minutes, but do bring an umbrella if the weather forecast is rain as there is no shelter for most parts of the walk: 

When I think of 'Bao' (Chinese bread), I expect a Chinese style cafe or something like that but when I entered the cafe, it was different from what I expected. I didn't read the review or find out about more this cafe as I wanted to get an element of surprise and I did! The cafe is quite spacious as there is good amount of privacy between you and the other customers. If you are in a big group (around 6-10), you be pleased to know there is a Long table and if needed, they just add a table or two. Perfect for some catching up as its quiet and not crowded for most of the time, according to another Yelper. 

Orders are self service and free wifi is available but you have to ask the staff for the password. It would be nice if they could leave the password either on the table or on the receipt. Staff were friendly and more importantly no sign of impatience or pressure to leave the cafe even though the group had finish the food for quite some time and got lost in the wonderful conversation. 

I ordered the Namban Chicken and Classic (check my photo of the menu for more information) and I find them to be my liking for my taste bud. Not the best but decent enough for me to make another trip back to try out the other flavours. Prices is reasonable and portion is definitely value for money. 

Overall, this is a great cafe for catching up and enjoying the ""bao""! Do drop by if you are nearby or have a craving for ""Bao"".",7

I have to say the decor for the place is absolutely spiffing and probably the thing Enid Blyton novels are made up of. Love the bits and pieces on display and for sale. Pick up some tea cups if you even want an extra quality in your life. You can just start with your first special tea cup, even if you don't want to pick up the entire set. Trust me when I saw tea works better in special teacups.

I've heard amazing things about their quiche and passionfruit meringue tart. Marcus' story about the place below sounds amazing so I'm looking forward to partake in the ""cook"" part of this cafe.

I know of a friend holding an engagement party at this very spot!

All in all, I'll give a go for the atmosphere alone - non-pretentious and pretty private amongst your seating space. The servers are polite and helpful without being too intrusive, something which I always appreciate. Will be back to try more of the food and review this spot again!",18

Tucked away at the end of the row of shops including Haato and E-Sarn at Ridgewood Close Condominium, I would not have known about it myself if a friend hadn't brought me there. Valle is a nondescript neighbourhood bar, but don't let appearances fool you. The bar is stocked with a smorgasboard of beers, ciders and ales from all over the world. I was shocked and delighted to find Paulaner Munich on tap for $12 a pint. In fact, all the drinks are priced super reasonably. You can get Rekordlig for $12 compared to the $15 you usually see it sold for at the bars in town. You can refer to this page <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.valle.com.sg%2Ffullmenu.html&s=ec5330c1c18a2a22149b8bc75e763fc8ee09006bfcd73b4434c79941498afea8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">valle.com.sg/fullmenu.ht…</a> for the incredibly comprehensive menu. The prices listed are delivery prices (yes, they offer delivery) but I believe the prices at the bar are $1 or $2 more. Needless to say, if you're an avid beer drinker, you will really like Valle. I also like the low key and casual vibe of the place. It really is your friendly neighbourhood bar where you can hang out and with your friends while enjoying a really good beer. Sadly, I've heard that the condo management has been forcing Valle's owner to revise the closing time earlier and earlier. While they used to close at midnight, they now have to close at 10pm, I'm guessing because of residents' complaints. This is probably why Valle's happy hour ends at 6 as the owner wants to encourage people to visit in the day. I do think Valle would be a really nice spot for a quiet afternoon drink as well.",21

I have the salted egg yolk ice cream, which was partly inspired by the Hong Kong yolk-filled custard buns in. It taste like the salted egg yolk found in mooncake, but surprisingly it's not salty, with a tad of sweetness, creamy, rich and filled with yolk in grainy forms. It was surprisingly good and really a refreshing take on the good old ice cream.

I'm a little surprised about the low rating for this place. My friend and I went there for dinner last night and we were quite satisfied with the experience.

We didn't have a reservation but the host was kind enough to offer to wipe down the table (it was pouring earlier) and seat us outside. They had mosquito coil under the table which I thought was a nice gesture, I was still bitten once but that's not too bad..

I love the fact that the menu is not too big and the waiters seem knowledgable about the food. Quick individual reviews: Cod (extremely delicious and was our favorite, perfectly cooked; the mushroom and spinach and broth complement the fish well), cauliflower (tender inside with a slight crunch on the outside), lamb ribs (must try, very interesting spices), bone marrow (i've never had bone marrow with snails but good combination), strawberry basil sangria (a little too sweet, would have been perfect for brunch).

Minus: Slow service. Price is probably average for Dempsey Hill :)",5

Service was good, attentive and non-intrusive. I asked about the iced-coffee and the server was able to explain everything AND accommodate my special request. No fuss!

The restaurant was clean and well-kept. The menu was small, but had pictures for most, so can't go wrong there. Gordon Ramsey will have a fit, I'm sure. ""NO PHOTOS IN YOUR MENU, ARE YOU STUPID OR SOMETHING?"" he'd yell. But me, I like to see a preview of what I'm ordering.

Souffles! Savoury and sweet souffles! Pancakes of incredible thickness, but fluffy and light like a... souffle! Each pancake is almost 2 inches thick! The french toast was also very good. I had a savoury souffle, and even though it was topped with a huge souffle, the dish was not heavy at all.

Price was slightly high for some items, but reasonable for others. The coffee items have a refill option of $3 or so.

We got two half&halfs - Chilli Crab and Pepperoni as well as Forest Mushroom and Parma Ham with Rocket. The pizzas are the thin crust variety which is perfect for when you're feeling peckish and not wanting to feel too full too quickly. I'd really recommend the Chilli Crab, my Favorite among the lot we chose. Truffle fries were decent, as with the flat whites. Spotted their promotion on margaritas when I was in the Ladies midway through our meal and decided to get a carafe of Strawberry Margarita to ease into the evening. Frozen margarita was a good idea; tangy refreshing and very much welcomed on the palate after too much carbs between two girls. A word of caution for the slow sipper though, frozen beverages doesn't take too kindly to our harsh humid weather so it didn't take too long till we had a quarter of our carafe left with unattractive slush floating on lukewarm pink liquid - and we were seated indoors!

Saw decent crowds in the cafe, so I decided to try it some time. 

Their brunch menu is pretty standard for a cafe (no proper kitchen, so everything is toasted or pre-made) - waffles, toast, granola, salad, etc. I ordered a Croque Monsiere (ham and cheese on toasted bread) and a matcha milk.

The Croque Monsiere was decent, but nothing to shout about. The matcha milk was pretty good (very lightly sweetened and not bitter). 

However, the cafe itself was small and seating was not cozy, which takes away from the experience. When I'm paying cafe prices, I expect it to be nice, intimate and cosy. It wasn't. They also don't accept credit cards, which is not really acceptable for the kind of food and prices they charge.

Overall atmosphere of this place was comfy and it has a very organic theme to the place. Plenty of seats and a stage for performances. Overall I loved the atmosphere. 

Food is not too bad as well, however I do have to point out I was here for lunch and all I had was the Dory Fish dipped with Beer Batter and the Carbonara. The Carbonara was lovely as it was not drowned in sauce like how a lot of places does it. It was however a little more to the dry side and I did wish for just a tiny bit more sauce. This fish was by far my favorite, golden crunch on the outside and moist on the inside. Definitely would recommend it.

I was late to the whole bingsoo craze (as always) and have honestly only tried 2-3 places. I was brought here by a very reliably up to date and discerning friend, and once I tried the Green Tea bingsoo (~$13), I was sold. The huge heaping bowl of icy white flakes, dusted with matcha powder and topped with a generous scoop of green tea ice cream, with free-flow condensed milk if you so wish...It's a lot for one person to eat on your own, and it's regrettably a lot more expensive than bingsoo in Korea (~$8SGD). It tastes relatively authentic though. The toppings are generous, and can be tasted throughout the whole bowl - not the type of dessert where the ending dregs are basically tasteless ice. The ice itself isn't actually sweet, and doesn't melt fast too. I love sharing a bowl with friends! 

Another good thing is, the seating area (next to the glass walls of Evolve martial arts gym) is spacious, quieter than other parts of 313 or OC, and rarely crowded. Thus a great place for leisurely chats! 

I've also tried the injeolmi bingsoo, which comes with peanuts, almonds and soy flour. A little too nutty for my taste, but very tasty, and loved the little chewy mochi bits. 

I can say I'm confident bringing friends here to chill - can't say that about many places!",10

*Coffee Review*
Baristart is a solid 4-star coffee venue ticking all the boxes! If you can handle the heat I suggest you sit outside at the slim table and enjoy the people watching in Tras Street which is an interesting distraction from your digital device ;) 

Inside is a very slick 'n' slim modern coffee shop which buzzes with activity. You order at the counter, take a buzzer, then wait for your coffee order to be ready back at the counter. This actually helps to keep that area free of a queue clutter --- and why are we all standing around waiting anyways when we have our stupid friend Nancy's endless insta stories to catch up on? [Note to Nancy: No one cares about your ugly cat Minxy!]

If I come here to work I generally pick the spot at the high chairs, with the wall-garden, facing the front door. This maximises serenity and peripheral optics.

The coffee has some solid options (usually fruity or nutty for the single origin aficionado's) and I almost always opt for the dark nutty single origin varieties as I like a dark 'n' rich roast - always sans milk. Otherwise I'll just opt for a soy latte. It's a good coffee, and definitely one of the best in the area. Also a solid place to meet for an interview or 1-to-1, as the sharp-looking surroundings should suit the business formality.

NB: Tras Street itself has many shophouses which have a mixture of full-length French windows and half-length casement windows so you'll be taking photos.)",15

Well. It was bound to happen. I went to a tourist trap. 

It isn't the exact replica per se of the famous TV show, but they've got the weathered couch and Monica's kitchen (off to the side of the main entrance) spot on. Of course, you'll notice some familiar decor (Joey's white dog art, Ross' Unagi moment captured on photo) around too. They play FRIENDS re-runs constantly on the big screen and everytime the intro song plays, the staff will stop to clap to the beat. 

Right off the bat, you'll notice that the menu is full of catchphrases and puns from the long running TV show, like Janice's Oh My God baby ribs, Chandler's Thanksgiving Dinner, etc. It's cute and funny, but not worth the multiple dollar signs. I was really glad that I had lunch beforehand, so I only paid S$8 for a latte. I had to do it, so I could also have the opportunity to sit on the couch and take my picture.

Very creative menu options for a dessert I truly love - vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso over it...the affogato.

This place takes that idea to the next level and starts mixing up all different types of ice cream flavors with different kinds of coffee and other toppings. Definitely worth a look for these reasons.

However, where my frustration comes is that there is no seating time limit policy and in a way it is a great problem for them to have. The place is a coffeehouse but also a dessert spot - you literally cannot eat an affogato if you have nowhere to sit. You can't have it for take out since the point of an affogato is a hot espresso over a cold ice cream.

Unfortunately, many patrons buy a shot of espresso or coffee and read a book or work on their laptop for much time as if it is a normal coffee shop, even during peak hours when there is nowhere to sit.

I hope they do figure this out as I would for sure come back much more often!",6

Their menu which arrived in the form of a jotterbook, which according to the staff, each and every book was painstakingly handwritten (so don't go spilling drinks or food on the jotterbook since it was someone's blood, sweat and tears!). They have coffee, lattes, beers, ciders, sodas and smoothies. They also have a range of cakes available and a little shisha place at the back where unlike other places, you don't have to smoking by the street side with the cars zooming by and people staring at you. It's a nice private enclosed open space at the back where other than the distant sounds from the other stores around Ogopogo, you can pretty much smoke in peace. 

If you are hungry, feel free to ask the owners for their food menu. They have an arabian food menu and an italian menu where once you order, the staff will run to the stores next door and place your order for you. 

I really like the ambiance of this place as it's very laidback, the staff are very friendly and the drinks are delicious! Will definitely come back for more here!",9

There is also a take away counter, like a traditional bakery with many tasty items calling out to be taken home. This take away counter presents another odd policy/system that should be better thought out. There are items at the take away counter that aren't on the menu, and you can't order them if you are dining in. This is such an odd decision, it is the same restaurant/kitchen the food is already prepared, sell the item for a dollar more and laugh all the way to the bank; yet they would not serve it. Speaking of serving items, our drinks arrived much after our food, and many follow up requests, even a freshly baked waffle came before Ice Lemon Tea. Even the second round of tea took so long to arrive, very disappointing.",6

The bad:  I know I'm going to get roasted for this (pun intended!), but the above is the list of all the good things about Nylon.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Feels like you're walking into someone's kitchen, so depending on whether you like that feel, it could be good or bad.  Took me awhile to locate the shop as it's buried beneath a HDB block.   By the time I got there, the LAST thing I wanted was something hot (because Singapore is hot!).  I came with a friend and we both ordered the recommended coffee, iced.  Drinks came out in a timely manner and we both intently sipped them outside (because there were already 3 people inside...i.e. packed house).  My friend thought her drink was a bit bitter, so she flagged down one of the staff for some sugar.  Their response, ""Have you tasted it?"".  God bless that pretentious barista I thought to myself as I nearly spat out a mouthful of my iced bean-from-somewhere-interesting coffee.  For the first time in awhile, I was transported straight to Williamsburg, Brooklyn (if you don't know, google it).

The ugly:  They deal strictly with coffee, so right there I have a cap of 4 stars.  I'm not a huge coffee fan, and by that I mean I drink 1-2 cups a day from various local spots and chains.  Is Nylon coffee good?  Yes.  Is it better than the rest?  Maybe.  Can anyone really tell?  Probably not.  Therefore, unless this place was on my way to work, I wouldn't make it a destination.  With nothing to eat and nowhere to sit I would prefer any other cafe around the way.  I'm so annoyed at Bean Snobs/Coffee Cults (I just made those up) that I'm borderline close to organizing a blind taste test just to prove that coffee is as much about climate, sensation and temper as it is about taste.  To put it another way, the best tasting meals are when you're hungry.  So, in short, people crave the experience.  Plus caffeine...can't forget about the spectacular drug caffeine.",8

I enjoy visiting the Tiong Bahru and Gillman Barracks outlets more as there's usually more space for parking and dine-ins. No wifi on site, self service for water and food collection (but they charge GST & service charge?), full parking lot right behind the store. If not, this outlet is about a 10 min walk from Tiong Bahru mrt Station. 

Waffles are great, you get 2 pieces of made-to-order Belgian waffles -- crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. $6 per 2 pieces can be pretty pricey, but it is a popular item. 

Roasted pistachio is my favourite flavour on their menu. Nutty, full-bodied flavour and nothing of that fake extract taste that you'll get from cheaper options. It's a premium flavour at $3.30 a scoop, but the ingredients are not skimped on. 

Other yums flavours:
Earl grey lavender -- one of their classics. Not too sweet and aromatic. 
Plain ole chocolate -- May be boring but done right. Rich and bittersweet. 
Mango passionfruit sorbet -- tastes like (sweet) frozen mango in a pint. 
Matcha -- quite an elusive flavour but was surprisingly good, bittersweet and creamy. 
Banana chocolate chip crumble -- simple and good. Tastes like real banana!

There are many many other flavours. Don't feel shy to sample at the store! They have a 1 for 1 deal on Burpple Beyond for their ice cream and waffles. 

If you're too lazy to head down to an outlet, they also deliver on GrabFood at $12 a pint for regular flavours, and $16 for premiums (+$3 delivery fee). Alternatively, order directly from Creamier and get free delivery over $60!",5

The few things being good coffee by local roaster homeground. And donuts in a multitude of flavours.

The donuts are just like the Haritts when I had the in Tokyo. It has this unique soft chew a bit like tender bread but is not like local airbread. The dough has a nice delicate flavour and the chew is somehow springy and not flatlines.

Their most popular flavour is the cream cheese and it costs more accordingly. It takes more effort and time to prepare. $3.20. This is my clear favourite. There is a slight saltiness to the cheese.

Matcha has the bitter kick of matcha powder, fun to share as a side. Chocolate is ok but I not a big chocolate person at all so if you are don't let me stop you.

I nearly rated it 4 stars. Because when I sidle up at 915am. Only 2 flavours are ready and cheese is only out earliest 11 plus am I told. Regardless they do sell out most days. The only table is outside where its usually hot. I do want to sit and savour my donut and coffee and not have it on the run.

If the top item isn't produced till half the day is gone and you can't eat it, how to rate for it. Luckily I had it on an earlier visit after lunch. The guy was so kind he did say he would deliver me a few as he would be near my office the next day. In the end the uniqueness of the taste of the dough with cream cheese and the texture, if that doesn't get the last star what does.

They are going to open Sundays soon. That makes it a fun day.",27

I'm so glad that this pastry shop filled the space once occupied by a dull furniture shop.

In my opinion the big draw of B&H are the pastries. The Pain Au Chocolat, croissants, French apple turnovers are all pretty solid. I particularly love the buttery crust of the Pain Au Chocolat. It's especially good after being heated (on request).

Unfortunately, the selection at B&H, particularly the main courses, is limited to just quiche and a few select sandwiches: Bacon egg mayo, tuna sandwich, etc. yikes, not good because I hate sandwiches.

Fortunately, this lack of selection is made up by a decent cup of Joe, in my case, a flat white. 

Given this limited selection, I can only give this place three stars. Group Therapy located a few steps away still reigns supreme in my eyes. The coffee selection is far superior and offers a full selection of high quality mains.

Would I come back? Yes, but just for the $3 Pastries and free water. :-)",14

We've also tried the nasi goreng pattaya which is not bad, as well as some hot plate dishes like crayfish, sliced fish, egg tofu and sup kambing. Everything was OK although the sup kambing not as good as the ones in Malaysia albeit less oily. The murtabaks are generally decent. The drinks ie the Milo Dinosaur are pretty good.

Every customer is only allowed to buy 12, and I ended up getting a dozen, because well, I'm already in line so why not??

We ordered a waffle with 3 scoops of ice cream to share. While I did not love the waffle, my friends did - I like my waffles crisp and light all the way through. This was a little dense and slightly undercooked in the middle which made it feel chewier and more substantial.

What I really enjoyed were the ice-creams! We got Pistachio, The Apiary, and dark chocolate. They were a little on the sweet side, but what is dessert without sugar anyway? My favorite was definitely the Apiary - it had a milk base with honey and vanilla, and also honeycomb. Yum on all counts!! The pistachio was fragrant but a little too sweet for me. The dark chocolate was heaven but I'm not a huge chocolate person.

I would go back to try their black and white sesame ice creams. Yum yum.",9

I ordered the Fortune Tea Set during their high tea hours. I thought the food was very delicious. Just what you would want for an afternoon pick up. My tea tower included one of the finger sandwiches, scones or muffins, and three macarons.

- Dec 16 to Jan 1st, 2017

Weekday Priced at $29++ Adult / $20++ Child below 12 / Weekends Priced at $33++ Adult / $20++ Child below 12 

If any of you interested to learn how to make their prawn noodles, assam laksa and ban chang kueh, last chance on 19 March 2016. Limited seats, call 68301156 to register now.

Here were some highlights from their Penang hawkers' fare buffet:

(1) Penang Assam Laksa

- Assam laksa, the best item I had that night. A bowl of thick bee hoon (rice noodles), soaked in pipin' hot broth made from fish and tamarind. Sourish, full of flavours, so SHIOK! Topped with pineapple slices, chilli buddy, shredded cucumber, torch ginger and complete with a small spoonful of prawn paste. I can have this everyday! Rating 5/5

(2) Prawn Noodles

- This bowl of ""hae mee"" (prawn noodles) wasn't as impressive as the laksa but was definitely comfort food. As told by the hawker chef, broth was made from piles of prawn heads, pork ribs and shells to obtain this robust consistency but I wished the taste was much stronger. Prawns given were really tiny, pork slices too dry but the rewarding part? Lotsa crispy pork lard! Rating 3/5

(3) Lor Bak

- A snack resembling our local fried prawn fritters (五香虾饼), this Penang version came with only 4 items; deep fried prawn, sweet potato, tau gua (fried beancurd) and handmade five-spiced meat roll. I love the meat rolls most while the other three were rather common. They were well marinated with good amount of chinese spices, not overpowering, while the meat was firm and juicy. Rating 3/5

(4) Penang Rojak

- This interesting plate of ""chinese salad"" caught my attention because of the ingredients used. Instead of the usual tau pok (fried beancurd skin) and dough fritters we had in our rojak, Penang version had jambu and green mango in it. Love the crunchiness of the fruits mixed in with the thick flavourful rojak sauce (prawn paste) and fragrant grounded peanuts. Not everybody could accept the pungent smell of prawn paste but I can and I quite like it. Rating 4/5

(5) Char Kway Teow

- Longest queues were found infront of this char kway teow stall. Everyone patiently waited, just to get their hands on this Penang's renowned char kway teow. A small plate of fried flat rice noodles in soya sauce, loaded with bean sprouts, spring onions, cockles, egg and prawn. Fragrant, savoury, semi sweet and least oily! It's a waste that my plate of CKT doesn't carry that smokey ""wok hei"" taste otherwise it would be perfect! Rating 4/5

(6) Kway Teow

- An ordinary looking bowl of dry kway teow with fishballs and shredded chicken. But the base sauce for tossing the kway teow was so yum! A mixture of Penang sweet sauce, dark soya sauce plus sesame oil, these sauces' combination seems so simple yet delicious and satisfying. Rating 3/5

(7) Pasembur

- This year's new item. A mixture of shredded cucumber pile, potato chunks, fried beancurd, Egg slice and thin crispy dough biscuits. Special? Yes, the sauce! The orange-coloured sauce on top was made from sweet potato! Sweet and slight grainy, interesting fusion taste when consume with the ingredients. Rating 3/5

(8) Ban Chang Kueh

- Crispy, sweet, buttery, loaded with lotsa grounded peanuts, so yummy so IRRESISTABLE! Nuff said :) Rating 5/5

(9) Chendol

- Personally, I felt this chendol wasn't as authentic as those I tried before, especially these greeny pandan jellies (If you know what I meant). Kidney beans were nicely done and not mushy, the thick caramelized  gula melaka was a highlight too but I prefer the portion to be more. Rating 4/5

Other stalls' delicacies include Nasi Lemak with Nonya Chicken Kapitan which had very fragrant coconut rice and nicely done ikan billis chilli, Oyster omelette which lack crispiness, Cuttlefish Kangkong and dessert Ice Kacang.

** The whole dining experience was really good, especially when dine with good friends. On site situation was crowded, even on a weekday Tuesday night, but all customers were really discipline and queued politely. Despite the long queues and busy nights, the hawkers cooking at individual stations were all smiles throughout. They were also kind enough to tell us more about the food recipes when asked upon. Thumbs up! Although each dish came in small portions but you could queue again, repeatedly, for your favourite choices, it's buffet anyway!!
For the price of $29++ on weekdays and $33++ on weekends, this deal was definitely worth! Hurry down before this fare ends on 27 March 2016. **",3

Been a long while since I gave a review but this was disappointing considering the number of coffee shop options in Orchard and the fact that Jewel prides itself as a specialty coffee place. As seen in the photo, the flat white was void of any latte art. The flat white was the exact opposite of thick and creamy and failed to bring out the flavour of the beans.

Similarly, the cold brew was diluted and failed to produce any distinct notes.

Overall, a disappointment. If you're in the area, you'd be better of at the cozy Plain Vanilla nearby which surprisingly serves better coffee.",27

Speaking of the ""Rolling Dumpling"", I would not have guess that it was inspired from Xiao Long Bao if not for the menu description as it lacked the distinctive traits of this classic chinese dumpling such as the slurpy pork broth. Yes, there were pickled ginger and succulent minced meat but the black vinegar dressing could not lift up the dish.

Nonetheless, the sparkling chemistry between the subtly spiced chorizos and the sweet caramelized onion jam in the ""Flying Pig"" left me clamouring for more. Its miso dressing did not overpower the dish and I wouldn't even mind if the sausage was spammed with even more of the tasty onion relish on top. 

As a person with a soft spot for fish, I thought I would love the ""Jumping Fish"" the most but it turned out otherwise. A bite into this voluptuous croissant revealed an oasis of minced spinach and salmon filling. The smoked salmon was not too salty but the filling, which reminded me of the classic Greek Pie Spanakopita, needed a shake of herbs to bring it to life. 

Another calorie-worthy croissant is the ""Running Egg"" that was garnished with non-heady Japanese spicy flakes. While ramen egg gurus might insist that the ""molten"" egg yolk could be more gooey, I thought the current consistency worked well with the bonito flakes and mayonnaise sauce, which contributed to the tasty umami flavours.

Prepared fresh in batches and kept warm in hotboxes to retain the temperature, all the croissants, except for the Ramen egg, are baked together with the ingredients. This results in a croissant dough that are more moist and chewy while the external layer retains a delightful crunch.

Each croissant is retailing at $4.50 each or you can select any two flavours to go with the tangy salad with yuzu dressing, dried cranberry and mixed seeds for $12. My suggestion is to enjoy these savoury croissants at the outlets where they are served piping hot and fresh from the oven. 

It's alright if your stomach acknowledged the aroma of caramelized butter by making some embarrassing growls in public.

Mine did but so did everyone.",29

It's self-service at this store, so while my friend scrambled off to pick some bites, I made a quick inspection of the premises. The bakery oozes a casual vibe and boasts such a wide array of breads, even I was tempted to try some. Prices are mid-range.

My friend returned to our table with a cup of hot chocolate, a croissant and a Squid Ink Bun with Smoked Salmon and Ham sandwich.The Squid Ink bun does look exotic with its jet-black appearance.  She said the hot chocolate was chocolatey enough. She loved the croissant - it was crunchy but did not splinter to little pieces. Her sandwich was piled high with heaps of fresh greens and slices of smoked salmon and ham. My friend could not sense any distinct squid ink flavour but found the bread very soft and buttery.

Most of the dishes is somewhat palatable but it is definitely not a food destination in itself. But when push comes to shove, I suppose anything would do at 4am in the morning.

Located inside a Hospital to begin with...  all in all, I have good experiences here.

May return when needed.

YES it is OPENED 24 hours..

Definitely GOOD in my books.

My favorite item is definitely the SPICY Chicken Puff.  From all the chocolate or mocha beverages to even purchasing the Pineapple Tart for Chinese New Year, I do not mind returning.

Added Bonus, to my acknowledgement, ALL locations of The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is Halal Certified by MUIS.  Overall 3.75 STARS!

As of P2HA, NO dining is allowed.  ONLY takeaways or to go orders plus, food deliveries options..  Hence plan accordingly.",11

We overheard the staff saying that the waiting time was about half an hour. Fortunately, we'd made a reservation, so we practically sailed right past the waiting line. 

I like the atmosphere of the cafe. It was open, inviting and bustling with activity. Perfect place for people-watching. We were seated on the balcony facing the stables. My initial concern was about the smell, but it was unnoticeable. 

We had the corned beef croquettes, Riders Burger, and homemade sausages with creme fraiche scrambled eggs. The croquettes were good - the crispy, golden brown breadcrumbs gave way to creamy potatoes with the occasional chewy beef bits. The corned beef offered a pleasant pop of flavour that accented the mild potato taste. They were truly enjoyable to eat. The portion was generous too. I expected maybe two pieces of croquettes but there were four - more than enough for a starter. 

The Riders Burger was all about the beef. The other ingredients were reminciscent of Burger King's Western Whopper, but they were all overwhelmed by the beef. This burger would be perfect for meat lovers.

I chose the homemade sausages and creme fraiche scrambled eggs because they came with a leek and potato rosti. Unfortunately they looked better than they tasted. The hollandaise sauce was the best part of the dish. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and creamy, but for the most part tasteless, but that was ok as we had salt and pepper at our table. The rosti was, strangely, creamy. It was essentially fried mashed potato and leek. There was a mild taste of leek on the fried surface, but that was overpowered by the flavourless mush that was underneath. Next to the mild flavours of the eggs and mush, the sausage tasted too strong, which shocks the taste buds. I dipped most of what I could in the hollandaise to get some flavour, but there was barely a spoonful of it to begin with. 

The food may have been slightly disappointing, but the service was excellent. The crew was attentive and proactive, and we could really tell that they were properly trained to provide high-level service. For that, kudos to the staff AND the owner/management of Riders Cafe for caring. 

Service really contributes half, if not more, to customer experience and satisfaction. For this, I would definitely go back to Riders (and order other things on the menu instead).",5

Start with the menu. The first page introduces the 2 chefs to you. but instead of telling you their food philosophy or style, is all about their experiences working in well-known places and how good they are. One chef is ""a gifted Chef"" and a ""prodigy of Celebrity Chef Sady Cerna"" (I think they meant protégé).

Furthermore, they have something really peculiar called ""enzymes"" which feature prominently in many of their desserts. I have no idea what their ""enzymes"" are, they probably aren't you know from biology (otherwise their desserts might decompose if kept overnight). There were samples of their ""enzymes"" on the table, and they looked like mostly-clear liquids (though one bottle had a lot of cloudy stuff at the bottom, making it look like what kombucha presumably looks like).

I ordered the ice cream (they were out of the ""enzyme"" creme brulees) and it was bad. I had 3 flavours: butterscotch, melon (with guava) and pineapple tart

The butterscotch ""ice cream"" was really butterscotch-flavoured heavy cream - it didn't have the taste and temperature of ice cream. The melon (with guava) ice cream had a noticeable amount of ice crystals in it. And the pineapple tart ice cream was very mild tasting.

Meanwhile, the ice cream was served with a really random assortment of toppings (apple, banana and nuts) and caramel sauce, which didn't harmonise well with the ice cream flavours.",5

So we heard about their waffles and had it with two scoops of ice cream. Waffles are two quadrants. It was slightly overdone on the color but still not bad. The ice cream was okay. They got my order wrong but lazy me didn't change it. Thought their dark chocolate ice cream is better than Speculoos flavour which is too sweet for me. 

Next up was Earl Grey mousse cake. It was way too sweet to my liking. Each time I reach for the cake, I could only slice a thin small piece with my fork. Thank god this cake is shared. 

They do serve mains. But I don't think I will be back anytime soon to try other stuffs.",3

When we got to Carpenter & Cook one Sunday afternoon, we were greeted simultaneously by the chatter of diners, the clinking of cutlery and the aroma of oven-baked goodies the moment we pushed through the wood-panelled door. As we waited in line for a seat, the couple next to us used a vintage display cabinet as a tabletop for filling in a form to have their pre-wedding shoot held here.

As with all wildly popular eateries, there's always a presumption that service will be brusque and impersonal. I'm happy to report that the servers we encountered at Carpenter & Cook were welcoming and chirpy. Furnished with rustic pieces acquired by one of its three co-owners from all over the world, the cafe exuded a homely and laid-back vibe in spite of the teatime crowd. Communal seating is practised here, which is fine by me since I've recently been trained not to attack openly affectionate couples.

Lavender Bundt Cake, $4.00 - Whilst surveying the pastries on display, we were a little taken aback by how steep the prices were. It took just four bites to finish this palm-sized bundt cake (we're talking preschooler hands here), which tasted quite uninspiring. It was my first encounter with lavender in cake form, though apart from some notes of cinnamon I frankly couldn't detect anything else in the cake. I also felt the honey glaze was superfluous since it added neither depth of flavor nor moisture to the cake, which was a little too dry.

Passionfruit Meringue Tart, $6.50 - Highly raved about in almost every review of Carpenter & Cook I've read, this tart had a crisp, buttery shell that broke off easily when you cut into it with a fork. The beautifully seared meringue peaks had a texture akin to toasted marshmallow innards... that's actually meant to be much more delicious than it reads. Found the passionfruit curd way too sweet, but supporters swear by it so if too much sugar's your thing, go right ahead and order this.

Smashing Savoury Brioche Bun (Veg.), $6.50 - A sprinkle of sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, olives and a couple sprigs of parsley on a fluffy brioche bun. I have to say the bun was moist, soft and wonderfully herby, but for six friggin' fifty? I wouldn't have ordered this if I were allowed to have things my own tyrannical way.

Triple chocolate chip muffin, $3.50 - This was a flat out disaster. The muffin was so dry that every poke of the fork triggered an avalanche of crumbs. Also, the chocolate used was sickeningly sweet and of exceedingly poor quality - I say this as someone who has no qualms about eating Van Houten chocolates by the boxful.

Flat White, $5.00 - Like any Singaporean cafe worth their salt, Carpenter & Cook utilises the Speakeasy blend from Liberty Coffee. Sadly, premium beans alone do not a good cup of coffee make. My flat white was served lukewarm, left a slightly acrid aftertaste, and came with zero art boohoohoo. Maybe it was because the cafe was crowded when we visited, but they could definitely pay a little more attention to detail for drink prep.

By the end of our visit we were left scratching our heads about the hype surrounding Carpenter & Cook. It's obvious that they have the leisurely come-burn-your-weekend-afternoon-with-us ambiance bit down pat, but food and price wise there's so much room for improvement you could fit Mariah Carey and her entourage in there. I'd like to think that we visited on an off-day. I guess I wouldn't mind coming back if I happen to be in the area, though it'll be an uphill task convincing me to go out of my way to visit Carpenter & Cook a second time.",4

In fact, all the tables of the coffee shop are occupied by patrons of the fish soup store, leaving little room for the other stores in the coffee shop.

The soup is amazingly sweet and delicious but not too salty. This is one of the few fish soup stores where I dare to order sliced fish instead of fried fish because their fish is really fresh and has no fishy smell at all! The thick beehoon is cooked just right too - not clumpy or soggy. 

They also sell pig's organ soup, pork porridge and yam rice to go with your soup. My suggestion is to skip the yam rice which is not very special. Try the fish soup and if you have space left, get the pig's organ soup too.",6

Tiny gripe is that with gst(?) my average latte from $5 came up to about $6.40. Pricey for 2 shots of coffee and some milk. 

I work around the area so that adds up pretty quickly.",4

The sweet and savory combo wins him over. 

For me I always end up with the pork cheek sandwich. I agree with Marcus L, a little bit more toasted would be great. But once Ive sunk my teeth into that porky, cheesy, oily goodness I forget all about it. The small salad that comes with it lets me delude myself of it being pretty healthy. 

Not managed to try much else at this cafe, I like that the seats are reasonably spaced out and I always manage somehow to get a table. So just based on that sandwich and French toast, will keep Flock cafe as my default place to go.",7

Loved the atmosphere, very siimlar to the bars we used to frequent in New York so I instantly bookmarked it for dessert places to take visitors. it's located right across from the popular thai joint we frequent in Holland V. 

We got the Churros and Hot chocolate dip, sold separately, and it was good enough, except that the churros kept falling apart and was a bit over fried. but you really can't go wrong with churro + chocolate, so it was satisfying enough!

The fail of a dish was the Purple, with blackberry sorbet and lavendar marshmallows, which we expected more from the price and by the raving reviews on Yelp. We had better desserts elsewhere for much cheaper- it was basically Manhattan prices with child-size portions and no wow-factor. Another downer was the sad waiter in his 20s- he looked as if he hated working there and didn't' say ONE word when handing us/collecting the check and as we were leaving.

The down side? Having to wait 30 minutes for it to be made on the spot. So if you are having dinner next door, come by and order it in advance and they will call you when it's ready.

I'm actually rather plebeian so subtle, nuanced eats and I don't really click. Next, I view hipster/indie joints with a morbid fascination. On one hand, it's revolting. I can't cycle so I don't see the allure of a bamboo bike. On the other hand, I quite like cement/brick walls and exposed pipes. 

Anyhow. You need reservations for this place. They write your name, time slot and number of pax on a rock so you know which table is yours, which is.. interesting because it looks like a bible verse. You know- Timothy 3:16 that kinda thing. 

Eggs are supposed to be done well here, so eggs it was. I had two eggs in a pepper puree sauce populated with an incredible amount of chopped sausage, while the other diner had eggs ben with maple glazed bacon. And because we were greedy, we had a cold cut platter to share too. And the eggs. Oh the runny eggs. My inner auntie frowns upon ordering a pair of eggs for $20 when you can get 10 for $2, but she's easily placated with cold cuts. Which were ok, really. Smoked salmon, parma ham and some cured meat thing that came with blue cheese and another slab of even smellier cheese. I do love me some smelly cheese. The mains fared much better though, and the other diner was pretty happy with the nosh. As the day wore on (we were there at 11), the place was absolutely buzzing with activity, but happily we were free to just chill. 

On the downside, the place is really cramped. Every time someone walks behind me, I get bumped, which is all the time. You can't really tell wait staff from diners, which can be a bit confusing since everyone's wearing those tortoise shell rimmed spectacles, sporting a tattoo or turned up pants. And the price point is on the high side for a place located opposite a cemetery (cemetery. symmetry. is there a link?). Would I return? Well, yes, but only when it's pay day.",18

The waiter are welcoming and are not intrusive at all despite the fact the place was crowded, which i really appreciate as I was able to catch up with my friend comfortably without feeling hurried to leave. 

Onto the main highlight, food. Pricewise, it's rather pricey (bout $30/pax) but portion is quite generous. We ordered the English breakfast and the Boulevard St Michel and it was delicious. I like the fact that jn both of our dishes, they successfully poached the eggs so it has firm whites but runny yolks which I adore. I also liked that they serve our dishes at the same time and are responsive whenever we call them although it was a busy day. 

Unfortunately, the coffee was a rather let down. We ordered the cold brew coffee but too bad it tasted more like your ordinary cup of joe on ice. I may be a bit of coffee snob but I believe cold brew should be slightly stronger and more aromatic. Nevertheless, my friend, whom is not a coffee drinker, enjoys it. So i guess it depends on your preferences.

All in all, i would recommend this place to people who seeks for a good brunch at central location. I would advice you to reserve your seats as it may be hard to get a seat, unless you don't mind sitting at the bar, facing the columns.",3

But even with its remote accessibility, its still packed! Because the food and ambience are something you'd travel for, they're that good.

To me, they have the best pancakes! Fluffy, buttery, creamy goodness with fresh blueberries and cream. Their poached eggs and salmon comes a close second. Plus enjoying it in a cosy setting against the greenery with horses grazing in the background doesn't hurt!

You can take a walk outside and maybe have your kids go on a pony ride (only $10!) after brunch, its not just a nice romantic brunch place but good for families too.

Final verdict: One of the most quaint brunch places in Singapore in one of the last countryside corners of this urban jungle.",14

I only came here for some cake and I got the upside down pineapple cake. I don't know why but seeing a badly sliced and sloppily presented cake annoyed me. It shows a lack of care in the attentive-level of staff.

When I went to pay, I noticed that other cakes (of other flavors) were similarly badly sliced. Woah. 

I really did think Clinton St Bakery was better than this. 

Taste-wise, the cake was fine. Not great, not terrible. The staff was sufficiently polite. But I think the devil's in the details and they need to teach their staff how to slice cakes properly, lift the slices and place them on plates.",15

She replied, ""up to you lor""

She asked, ""the burger""

Coffee-wise, I really didn't think that they were as good as Nylon etc. Passable but it wasn't impressive.

Service was also rather slow that day. My steak came out on time but my friends' food didn't. 

Ambiance-wise, Wheeler is unbeatable! A beautiful hipster cafe! I love the concept and the deco. Not so much the location and the parking. There's barely enough lots to fit 5% of the customers. They only have 4 lots out front. All 4 were taken when we arrived.

Then Jim Thompson used it for a bit as a our side bar area.  Now its Open Farm Community.  As a member of the community I welcome it!

Totally redo its reminds me of the farm to table restaurants in the USA.  Very shabby/rustic chic interior with wood floors and walls, floor to ceiling windows facing the herb farm.  Small bar area, open kitchen and cool lighting with reclaimed rot iron panels on the ceiling with fairy lights,  

Try the chilled avocado soup, its to die for. I order it every time, clean, fresh, cooling for this climate.  Mains I've had are the barrumindi grilled to perfection and rigatoni is done with a pesto sauce that is not too oily or too basil infused.  I also have had the warm broccoli salad with pine nuts, just devine,  It is truly warm and not hot or luke warm.

I prefer the more ""local"" atmosphere at Chye Seng Huat Hardware (CHSS), where there is a livelier vibe and coffee aficionados are actually speaking with one another rather than having their heads buried in a mobile device.

A large dining room welcomes guests to a full breakfast and lunch menu complete with creative and delicious dishes as well as wonderfully prepared coffee drinks.  Bonus points for the French glassware in which lattes are served, I had purchased these very same glasses at Merci in Paris last November.",6

Either the cup was smaller than my usual or that the coffee was indeed too good for me to notice my greedy gulps (I swear I thought I was sipping :().

Alas the service staff were too zoned out to make me feel embraced. The place was relatively big but emotionless.",7

From the outside, it doesn't look like much. 
Even at a first glance, the menu isn't fancily done.
But what it lack on these aesthetics was made up 100% by the food. 

Omelette ($10.90)
Freshly made and piping hot, the omelette isn't your fold over, elegant omelette. These are more, cook-in-a-skillet, hearty, home made omelettes and it tasted like it too. 
Made with really fresh ingredients, it was lightly seasoned and allowed each ingredient to be nicely highlighted. 
Simple, fuss free, hearty and satisfying. 

Egg Island ($14.50 + $4.00 for additional grilled mushroom) 
This feels like the ultimate comfort British breakfast. 
Baked beans were nicely cooked, soft without being mushy. 
The poached egg was perfect. And I mean PERFECT! The white wrapped around the yolk beautifully and the yolk was nice, thick and runny.
Sour dough was pretty good without being too sour (which I personally prefer). The mushrooms were well cooked with minimal seasoning but was packed with flavor and the sausage was so so so good. 
Not overly seasoned, the sausage had a great meat to fat ratio and was nicely coarse. Yummy!

The food here was very well done. Slightly on the mid-price side due to most of their ingredients being organic or free ranged (which is better than paying for for ""fancy"" all day breakfasts) but what they did was make a good hearty breakfast... well... good and hearty without being overly fancy or hipsterish. 

Will definitely recommend you check out this place if you're around the area and Oh! (All pun intended), it's also a grocery store so you can grab some really great ingredients while waiting for your food to be served too!",15

Anywhere in one north is almost exclusively catering for ex-pats and high-income locals. Jimmy Monkey is no different. Egg's Benedict will run you a whopping $24, pancakes are $14, and the french toast is $17.

They had run out of pancakes on a Sunday at noon so I went with the french toast, and added on a chocolate, peanut butter, speculoos shake for good measure. This was not a wallet-friendly brunch but I was happily surprised by how tasty everything was. The french toast comes in a healthy serving, and includes berries and crème fraîche. By the end I was actually struggling to finish my serving because everything was so sweet.

I wouldn't be opposed to returning but this place is definitely a treat, and not a joint for regular meals. Seating is fairly limited, but somehow sufficient for the number of patrons.

Not my first time at Hoshino Coffee, but this is probably going to be my last. At least for this branch. 

They are known for their drip coffee, matcha and soufflé. They have pretty good pasta too. This is based on past knowledge and past visits.

Today, we just popped in for a cup of matcha green tea. ($7!) For a Japanese chain, ordering matcha green tea should be a very safe choice. Unfortunately, it was extremely terrible! It tasted like instant green tea, it looks green but taste plain and bitter. It super disappointing. 

The thing that annoyed me most was the horrible smell. It smelled like stinky sweat all over the fabric of the sofa. It was so bad that I had to ask my friends to move to another seat. It stink too but was just so slightly better. I highly suspect it's the dirty, moist and stinky cloth that they use to wipe across all the surfaces that is causing the stench. 

The only redeeming factor is that the service is good. Good but not enough to redeem itself from the horrible smell and drink.",8

It's one of those places I'd been meaning to try for years, literally, and I finally got round to it about about 2 months ago - this tells you I've got quite a backlog of reviews!

Kith offers a decent selection of food (ranging from biccies to small bites to traditional full breakfasts and to sandwiches) at reasonable price points, e.g. $10 for a sandwich.  Our table only tried several simple food items like the smoked salmon sandwich, brioche with yogurt and strawberries, and a tuna + green apple toastie.  Even simple dishes can sometimes go awry, but I'm happy to report that all these items were well executed and presented.

Where I felt a bit let down was in the coffee department.  I'd heard a lot about Kith's coffee and had been tremendously looking forward to trying it.  However, the coffee was disappointingly average.  I'd certainly put places like Toby's Estate and Smitten above Kith in the coffee stakes.

Still, Kith is a pleasant place that's hard to dislike.  It's a comfortable place which is family-friendly, pet-friendly and offers ample people watching opportunities.  If I lived in RQ, I'd be happy to call it my local.",4

In a tight group of 8 friends, 7 of them live pretty close to Sin Hoi, and these 7 congregate here for dinner at least 2-3 times a week.

On the few occassions I've been here, service has been excellent, also in part due to the fact that my friends are regulars. They swiftly take your order for beverages, leave, bring them to your table and collect your food orders while they are at it. On weekends this place does get crowded, so avoid peak dinner timings, or be prepared to wait for a table and for your food orders to be served.

We have a few favourites, I'll list them out - do be certain to give them a try! We love going for their sambal char siew fried rice, prepared with an adequate amount of spice and served in a portion good for 1 person. We swear by their Indonesian chicken dish, a slightly tangy crispy chicken dish where the fried chicken is glazed with a light, spicy gravy and onions. Being chicken fans, we almost always have to have their hot plate chilli ginger chicken as well - a bowl of it dropped right on to the hot plate at your table so it's sizzling and all the more enjoyable when had with the fried rice. The few other favourites include their baby kailan in oyster sauce, crispy noodles, fried salad you tiao, sambal kang kong and prawn paste chicken. 

Their menu is expansive, and I wouldn't say that the food here is inexpensive, but given it's prime location and good quality, you pay for what you get. (I spend an average of $10 - 15 here including soft drinks and food shared with about 4-5 friends). I would definitely have to come back here many more times to try everything else on their menu.

Prices are really reasonable, for a family dinner with 4-5 dishes, we would probbly pay $60- $70.

 It can get really crowded and noisy over the weekends. So if you're starving maybe it's not so good an option to go for dinner on a weekend.",11

She keeps things simple and in this day and age, it's the most welcoming approach to bakeries. While her HV store is small and cosy, this is welcoming and enticing. I love the wide space and benches. The counter space allows us to stand in front and ponder. Her selection as always, spoils us like an only child in the family. I am always drawn to a salted caramel or special of the day. 

A new old favourite is earl grey lavender cuppie. An old because I always had it in USA but never in Singapore. Thank you for bringing it here.

Reservations HIGHLY recommended. We visited on a Sat morning at 11, right when it opened, without a reservation. We were turned away by the hostess, who informed us that the restaurant was fully booked till 3. She did offer to seat us at the bar, thankfully, which held only 4 people. Other customers who arrived later without reservations were turned away disappointedly - not a very smart move, given that I saw many empty tables that were being held for later reservations. Service staff weren't very forthcoming nor friendly either, and the food did take some time to arrive. Not ideal for the brunch rush hour. 

Coffee is by Common Man, so they were expectedly decent. :)

We tried:
- Eggs Benedict with poached chicken, spinach, semi-dried tomatoes, sourdough & green curry hollandaise sauce ($24): eggs were beautifully poached, yolks were a rich golden orange. I particularly enjoyed the twist on the hollandaise though. The green curry taste definitely shone, though it might not be for everyone. 

- Truffle scrambled organic egg, shimeji mushrooms, portobello mushrooms, baby spinach & sourdough ($24): would recommend ordering this dish. The egg was soft and flavorful and the mushrooms were generously portioned. Went excellently on the sourdough. 

- Lemon tart with basil ice cream ($17): I'd heard so much about this dish before visiting that I HAD to order it (despite the price). It didn't disappoint. Presentation was gorgeous and was reminiscent of a Mille-feuille. I'd have preferred the lemon curd to have been on the tarter side though. The basil ice cream was refreshing and went wonderfully with the lemon. Thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Portions aren't big for the price, but we left satiated. Would return to try its other dishes during lunch/dinner!",8

Basil Chicken Rice with Egg - they have a spicy and non-spicy version and we opted for a non-spicy as my girl is not sure if she can handle the spice level here. She loved it! I had a mouthful and it's actually pretty good. Good flavours without being overly salty. 

Tom Yum Soup with Tanghoon - I'm happy that its not the instant Tom Yum sauce version. The soup is slightly creamy and tasty. The ingredients is about 3 slices of fish and 3 medium sized prawns. I will order this again. 

Chicken Chop Rice Set - my girl insisted that I try her Rice and chicken Chop although I told her, deep-fried chicken Chop taste the same anywhere. Which it was, it's ok nice.

This is the best out of the old-world cafés (Ya Kun, Wangz, etc) in my opinion.

Then what's with all the nice nice places to sit and the pretty pretty deco? Anyways... 

Was given a seat, given the menu, and was told to go order at the counter. Which is all well and good - a lot of cafes does that. Menu is kinda basic, don't expect a lot to choose from. And after paying, was told that I had to collect my food as well. Okieeeeee... Bear in mind the kind of prices you are paying .... 

Order pizza, a salad, a cuppa coffee and a juice. When I went to collect the food, all were in paper boxes.... But ok, they did say take away only. The salad came in the box and we were suppose to share so I went to ask for another box. I was told that they don't give any more boxes.  was the expression on my face. Went to take two paper cups to use as container to share out the salad. 

Not the most environmentally friendly kinda place. And for the a-bit-above-average-cafe-prices that you are paying, I think it's only right to expect a wee bit more. 

That said, if you are willing to pay that price for take away only, you are in luck, because the food is decent. I liked their pizza but the whole experience really put me off.

Although pricey, it is a lovely place to go for a special night out or a date - and the food is surprisingly good!  The portions are big, and the ribs that I had were drop off the bone fantastic - even better than the ones at Lawry's the Prime Rib! The meat was soooo succulent and easy to take off the bone, and the coleslaw and fried onions that accompanied it were executed just as well.

The fries ($12) are huge, thus explaining the price. You could happily share a plate between 4 people - but it smelt so strongly of bottled truffle oil that it really took the flavour of the fries themselves away. Think it would have been better served salted and with sweet chilli and aioli.

Be sure to make reservations: we didn't think reservations were necessary on a Thursday evening, but boy were we wrong; the restaurant was a full-house, so we were ""banished"" to the counter seats at the bar.

We had:

1) 'Hail Caesar' ($25): a novel deconstruction of the classic green salad, with romaine lettuce cups cradling tender slabs of smoked chicken, layered with 5J jamon, the thickest ever parmesan crackers, slicked with a light horseradish caesar dressing, and finished with soft-boiled egg confit and garlic croutons. This was well-executed, elegant, incredibly balanced, and the best caesar salad I've ever had. A must-try.

2) Sweet Corn & Basil Soup ($19) chunked up with charred baby corn, caramelised onion strips, and mopped up by fluffy hunks of pita bread - velvety smooth and nuanced.

3) Mud Crab Pappardelle ($29): the sweet flecks of shredded crabmeat complemented the mild Thai curry gravy swirled with coconut milk, dotted with yellow squash, and topped with fried Thai basil leaves. Despite the spice, this was very restrained.

4) 48 Hour Barolo Braised Oxtail Strozzapreti ($26): unabashed and bold, the smoky sweet of the wine highlighted by the heft of the meat, and cut through by fresh thyme and parmesan crisps.

5) Coconut Laksa Barramundi ($29): outstanding as well, the skin of the fish seared to a tantalising crackling, yielding luscious moist flesh underneath. This was sided by an otah-potato cake blend, blanched bok choy and garnished with chilli oil beads that looked like ikura",6

I love that apiary has many craft flavors and they rotate often. My favorite is definitely black sesame, featured in my post. Not too sweet, just the right amount to end the night. It was pretty funny that the cone was sweeter than black sesame when I tried it another time, so that's probably not a combi you'd want. Other interesting flavors are uji matcha, blue milk, Ferraro roche. 

In general, apiary ice cream is the smooth kind. So if you like more texture in your ice cream, they have very few flavors with nuts and crunch added. 

There are some tables around for you to enjoy your dessert and hang out with friends. Probably enough to fit 15 or so people so it does get a little crowded on weekends.

Their rice has been known to be stewed in a special sauce, which turns in brown. It was great because the rice was tasty enough to be eaten alone. The duck meat was tender and very lean. Together with the sauce that it was covered in, it was delightful without an overpowering herbal flavor. This dish is great when eaten with their ikan bilis chili.

The cafe is just a stone throw away from Lavendar MRT Station. It's quite a popular place for some breakfast and brunch. It was a last minute idea that we came here for a meal, but for a dinner.

Interior feels cosy under the orange lights. In fact the theme of using transparent containers with the bulbs in them gave the environment a rustic feel altogether with the wooden tables and chair.

I bet everyone hear about their Rosti and comes here for this! The homemade potato rosti was awesome accompanied by a pretty sunny side up egg, wedge of lemon and a spat of sour cream. The Rosti was pan-fried to crisp at some parts and texture was perfect without being too burnt. If I were to compare Rosti from Marche, both as are tasty, just that the differences is that Oberstrasee Rosti are more of wider and shorter while Marche's were machined cut thus the size of it is uniform.

Sunny Rosti - $11

Sandwichies are served in freshly baked Ciabatta with Smoked Cheddar, Coral lettuces, Tomatoes and Onions. It consist of Norwegian smoked salmon, Avocado spread, horseradish dill sauce and alfalfa sprouts.

Smokled Salmon & Avocado - $12

I had the Duck Confit as my main course that come with 2 sides and I had the homemade slaw as well as the House Salad. The color combination of this course looked pleasing to the eyes with purple slaw and Salad drenched with roasted sesame dressing. On the other hand the Duck Confit was deep fried, though it was a tad on the dry side, it was well complimented by the Lingonberry Sauce that elevated the dining experience of the dish.

Duck Config with Lingonberry Sauce - $18

It was quite quiet during the night and perhaps many would come for their brunch or breakfast. Service was friendly and prompt. The only down side I would have think of is perhaps the smell on the clothing after dining. I don't mind returning for sausage and rosti.",7

BAKE opens at 10am and I arrived less than 10 minutes before opening.  No one was at the queue, so I roamed to the store front to check things out.  The tarts are baking in the oven and one of the staff waved at me to ask me to queue.  When I got to the queue, there were three ladies waiting.  5 more minutes until opening and about 15 more people are in queue.  A staff came out to the queue right at 10am sharp to hand out confirmation cards to the first two people.  10:03am and it was my turn!  The staff looked at my baby and I and asked how many I was getting. When I said a dozen, she was like ""oh, only 12, ok, here is your card"" as if she was expecting me to buy more with a baby in tow. Thank you for acknowledging my baby as a person!  The cashier was very friendly and informed me that the tarts can be refrigerated up to 4 days, or kept frozen for up to one month! Don't microwave.  Reheat in toaster, oven or air fryer at 200C for 30 seconds to a minute.  Got it!  Out the door we go to try these babies.  By now my 20 month old is screaming ""Chee taat Chee taat.""  I carefully peeled the sticker off to open the box.  I really appreciate BAKE's thoughtfulness in designing their boxes.  Each tart has it own ""compartment"" so they don't bump into each other and become mush.  First bite into the freshly baked tart is the crunchy crust that snaps off, then comes the warm fluffy, light and whipped cream like cheese filing that's has a hint of tartness.  The contrast of the crunchy shell and of fluffy cheese filling is heavenly.  I slurped the cheese filling down like one would with whipped cream, and finished off the crunchy crust with the next few bites.  15 mins late, after I settled by baby down for a drink, the cheese tart shells are getting softer and losing its crunchiness.  Now it has become more of a soft cookie texture.  When I got home, put some in the fridge, and a couple in the freezer to try the different ways of eating these babies.  The refrigerated ones tasted just ok.  It's sort of like an over beaten cheesecake, nothing like ice cream.  While the filing is soft, it has a lot of air bubbles, so it's not creamy.  The frozen ones were more like frozen cheesecake, hard and crumbly.   Hubby and my children tried it and no one care for the frozen ones.  

So my conclusion is that the BAKE cheese tarts are best eaten right after you buy them.  Enjoy the contrast of crunchy cookie shell and the fluffy whipped filling.  

Are they worth 1-3 hr wait? Nope!  If I need a cheese tart fix, the bakery across has lava cheese tarts, while not as fluffy and whipped cream like, those were creamier, cheaper, and no queue.",4

Cute little place that's an undiscovered gem.. For now.

It's kind of funky and retro at the same time. Tv sets, tin carriers and other old school paraphernalia sets the mood. The mad mix of mismatching chairs also adds to the charm of the place. 

Come here for the coffee! Using beans from Toby's estate, the coffee is well balanced and easy to drink, and does not even require sugar!

Other than coffee, thy also have chai lattes, craft beers and ciders available all day. Check out the Japanese Hitachino Nest flavours - the one that caught my eye was the espresso stout! Definitely an interesting taste to it! :)

Lovely desserts and cakes here, ad I really enjoyed the cookies and the mango passion fruit cake there too. It went perfectly with my coffee!

Because its so new, they haven't really gotten a full menu set up yet. However they have partnered up with other nearby restaurants, so you can go there and enjoy a variety of cuisines such as Italian and middle eastern! But that's for another review.

Lastly, there's a cute little outdoor area one can smoke shisha in. Really loved the entire feel and ambience of the place, and the friendly, attentive staff on duty there.

Am keen to see what else Ogopogo comes up with! I'll definitely be back! I've also just found out that if u call in advance, they will prepare your order and run out for a drive by takeaway! Perfect for those on the go, especially since parking can be a little tricky around that area!

And I love the fact that the name is a palindrome. Make sure you check out their handwritten exercise book menus - they're super cute and fun!",7

Decor is welcoming and not so hipster it makes your teeth ache. The vibe is cosy and relaxed. 
We sat down and ordered breakfast. We were the only ones in the cafe. 
Dude running the place recommended the breakfast set - $12 for coffee and kaya toast with scrambled eggs. Sounded good so I ordered that. The BF went for hot dog. 
So we waited. And waited. 
6 mins later the coffee came. 
We waited and waited. 
Dude went out to chat with cabbie friend. 
20 minutes later, my kaya toast came. 2 slices of mass produced bread. Scant kaya on one slice. Scrambled eggs was fluffy and moist. But I can make this at home with better toast and more kaya. 
The hot dog took another 10 minutes. Probably cos he had to chop cabbage for the salad. 
Verdict : coffee is ok but the food is overpriced and meh. 
Can hang out for coffee. But the area has better food elsewhere. Sleepy neighbourhood joint is fine and good but this is too sleepy for my taste.",7

They bring in a small range of tiong Bahru bakery's bread and have their own cakes. Their coffee menu is also pretty standard with reasonable price and size, great for the office crowd nearby who wants an upgrade from the local kopi. 
Had the ratatouille pasta, a vegetarian pasta with squash, cherry tomatoes  and a veggie stock base   The pasta was surprisingly quite good! 
Liked their raspberry cheesecake too 

The coffee is also decently made with a decent size 

I see myself coming back to try the rest of the menu!",3

I know my fellow reviewers say that its the perfect post-Zouk clubbing spot, but honestly, I know for a fact that revellers from Mink and Butter come to this perennial popular supper spot for food too. Food wise, Spize has an extensive menu. It serves local classics like prata and roti john. Portions are pretty sizeable - which might not be the best idea if you're going directly to bed after this, but it sure helps in soaking up alcohol. Some drawbacks to Spize though are its spotty service, and the non-existent parking available. But considering the location, I think you'll be hard pressed to do better.",15

The service staff were friendly and eager to please. 

Unfortunately, the food though decent, isn't good enough for me to specially return for it. I had the eggs blackstone (English muffin, spinach, tomatoes, eggs, rosti) and a flat white. The coffee was better than I expected - low in acidity. I was excited about the apple pie based on previous reviews, but it didn't live up to the hype. I prefer a harder crust; the filling had just the right hint of tartness and sweetness. My friend really enjoyed his chicken sandwich which he ordered based on the recommendation of another reviewer. 

It's a nice place to hang out with friends but if you're a picky eater, it may not live up to your expectations.

While many may say that the toast or the eggs are not very special or that the food is expensive but one of the biggest draws for me is the convenience of the drinks to go. They are pretty efficient with the dual counters and dual queue system which enables the crazy, hungry and thirsty crowd at Raffles Place to get their drinks to go.

The other big plus for me is that the cashier has somehow identified me as a regular and remember what my usual order is (I tend to buy large amounts of honey lemon drinks to go) and she is ever cheerful and helpful, sometimes giving me good recommendation for new drinks I'd like to try.

The honey lemon here comes with 2 slices of lemon and a very generous amount of honey to sweeten things up. I wouldn't say they use great honey but when you do try to press the lemons farther before drinking, the sourness from the lemon slices and the sweetness from the honey comes to a nice balance.

As a few others pointed out, if price is an issue, do go to Golden Shoe for better priced drinks and food. But the service here plus the convenience and pretty good speed of fulfilling their orders would keep the crowds coming.

As a side note, they do have a main competitor Teahut which also makes excellent honey lemon, but they tend to be a little generous with their honey and lemons.",3

They have some kind of neato popsicles but didn't try those. Hokkaido milk flavor was one that stands out. Honestly ducked in here to use the restroom bc I didn't wanna use the ones at the market. The hub got some English tea and a cream pastry which he said was alright. It was bright inside. And the bathroom was super cute and clean although outdoors kind of so felt hot. Still grateful to be able to use it. They also have French macarons which were v pretty. Not sure of the taste though.,3

I have finally made my way to this place, and it couldn't be sooner - the food is light and clean (on the palate; hygiene here taken for granted) and varied in both flavor and color, and there's a relaxing vibe to this place that lends itself to lazy weekend brunches.

great service too, and reasonable prices given the quality and type of food served - it's worth the drive/ trek.

shangri-la is one of those chains that's sort of familiar and posh without trying too hard - and it always has this languid vibe about it that's rather reflected in this restaurant - filled with lunching ladies in flowing dresses, set by the pool side.

the mostly mediterranean-styled food is laid out on a long, gorgeous wooden table - 
many different flavors and all well-balanced-and-seasoned - but it's a light flavor profile that seems much better suited to women. but to bulk things up, the lunch sets also offer the option of an additional set course - anything from fish to beef.

my main courseof  fish was properly seared - the skin was suitably crispy, the meat flaky, and the little salad on the side of baby carrot and corn was plenty tasty.

but you don't need the main course - we were just being greedy - the salads are pretty much sufficient for a satisfying, sating weekend lunch, without any of that usual heft that necessitates a post-meal siesta (though you can still take one, if you're so inclined). delicious food - tastes and feels almost like you're in a leisurely holiday town - well worth the almost unbelievably reasonable price for lunch.",25

Set up to look like a library, The Reading Room has a varied selection of books to read (and to purchase) while being a full functioning café. I only went for afternoon drinks and was delightfully surprised by very nice happy hour offerings, on glasses of red and white wine as well as on beers, and other drinks. It did look like it had a nice brunch menu, and their burger offerings for dinner looked quite nice. At around 6:30 PM however, they shut off most of the lights, which I think was a real mood killer. No need to have lighting resembling that of a sketchy club, when you are in a nice café where people want to go to talk each other, and in fact, see each other too.",5
