Modern vibes and spacious seating but definitely on the more expensive side. We got pasta and panini but honestly neither of them impressed us. Chicken in the pasta was way too dry and the dish wasn&amp;#39;t too flavorful. Same issue with the panini. We didn&amp;#39;t try their drinks so maybe that&amp;#39;s their selling point. Great place to chill but skip the dining.

It&amp;#39;s located at the first floor of McPherson community centre, and utilises their wifi. It&amp;#39;s very spacious, and it&amp;#39;s even got a small slide in the corner for kids to play in. I wasn&amp;#39;t that hungry, and ended up ordering their truffle fries and their laksa pizza, along with a &amp;#39;matcha Kopi&amp;#39;.<br&gt;<br&gt;Their menu is pretty extensive and locally inspired, including things like a Chili crab pasta and a salted egg yolk prawn pasta. They also do burgers and pizzas. The laksa pizza I had was interesting conceptually, consisting of their own homemade bread topped with prawns, fishcake, curry leaves and boiled egg. I enjoyed it as it was a thin crust, but honestly it felt more like a glorified bakery bread. It wasn&amp;#39;t bad, but at $16.90, it&amp;#39;s a little steep. As for the truffle fries, the truffles it was topped with were questionable. <br&gt;<br&gt;However, I have to admit that I really like the layout, and it&amp;#39;s very communal. The staff need some work in terms of explaining the menu, but otherwise, I actually really liked the coffee! They also do a salted caramel latte, so next time I might try it. They&amp;#39;re apparently famous for their rainbow cake, which looked really delectable, and topped with things like cookies and cream and salted caramel. Overall, seems like a good place to do some studying and work if you&amp;#39;re in the area, though more for coffee and dessert than the food, which is a tad overpriced. Might try their pasta next time! Definitely a good concept to put it in a CC, I&amp;#39;ll have to come back again and update my review then, with photos of the rainbow cake!"

NOM&amp;#39;s interior is set up with several square tables so they can be very flexible with any party size. A great plus point over fixed sized booths, which only accomodate so many people.<br&gt;<br&gt; <br&gt;This is the entrance of NOM at MacPherson Community Club on a tuesday night 8pm. I parked across the street, at the HDB car park and there was a summon aunty walking around checking coupons, so do take note!<br&gt;<br&gt; <br&gt;Cheese and tomato pizza was okay, nothing fancy. Big enough to share.<br&gt; <br&gt;For the kids meal, we got pasta and the gravy tasted fine, except for the pasta penne itself, it was abit hard.<br&gt; <br&gt;Their chicken leg was done pretty decently and the meat pretty much fell off the bone and you wouldn&amp;#39;t need a knife to eat this cleanly. So thumbs up for this.<br&gt;<br&gt;I liked it better when they served full portobellos. For $9.90, this is literally one or at most two portobello mushroom caps sliced up, breaded and fried. Totally a rip off.<br&gt;<br&gt;Everyone loved the ribs, even though I found it a bit too hard, there was only one bone in there though. So tons of meat for sharing.<br&gt;<br&gt;Being that this is my second time, I figured I knew what I wanted. But I was so wrong, the quality has dropped. I am not sure if I would be back for the rosti. Refer to my previous review in SEPT/OCT and see the pictures of the Rosti, it looks so different. I even feedbacked to the young waitress whom politely asked if I wanted the Rosti recooked, but I said, forget it, my friends had already dug into it. But even my friend who came in JB, mentioned that Marches&amp;#39; Rosti is so much better and even cheaper than this. <br&gt;<br&gt;So, the newest addition to NOM is their rainbow cheesecakes which I did not see in September. It is quite solid, so I know for sure there&amp;#39;s at least 2 blocks of Philadelphia cream cheese in there or more. It can be quite gerlat, so do share it, so just eat it and run 10km at the gym the next day.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had tried their chocolate and oreo rainbow cakes before and this was my first time trying their salted caramel cake. Everyone really liked the salted caramel rainbow cake smile And some of my friends mentioned that they would be back to try other cakes, definitely not the Rosti though.<br&gt; <br&gt;At $8.90 a slice, rainbow cakes here aren&amp;#39;t cheap but they&amp;#39;re at least decent. The Rainbow cakes were priced at $7.90 a slice just 2 months ago.. :(<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad that NOM is sensible enough to price this rainbow cheesecake at $7.90, one dollar less than the rainbow cake itself. Being that I do bake cakes, I also know well that a rainbow cheesecake takes ALOT less time to make than a normal rainbow buttercream/sponge cake.<br&gt;<br&gt;The best upside to NOM is that it is nett priced, but I believe their prices seem to be going up some dumb reason."

It wasn&amp;#39;t too crowded, there was just another family there with us. My first impression of the place was that it was bare and clinical, with the stark white walls, cement floor and white tables and chairs. It felt.. cold. The mandopop music played through the speakers made me feel even more like an outsider.<br&gt;<br&gt;I would say the food was average. We had the atlanta eggs benedict, blackstone eggs benedict, truffle fries and chocolate rainbow cake. <br&gt;<br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with the best part- the cake. We got it only because it&amp;#39;s supposedly the thing you must try if you&amp;#39;re there. I&amp;#39;ve never been a fan of rainbow cake because they don&amp;#39;t really taste like rainbows (cheat my feelings, you know?), but I&amp;#39;m glad I tried this one. The sponge was moist, fluffy and full of flavour, even without the chocolate icing. The icing was decadent - rich, creamy chocolatey goodness that melts in your mouth (and in your hands, I checked). <br&gt;<br&gt;The truffle fries were amazing as fries, not so much as truffle fries. They were actually cut potatoes and I believe they were air-fried or baked, so they were not greasy. The fries were crispy on the surface and hot on the inside. Unfortunately, we could barely taste the truffles. In terms of taste, the shaved parmesan on top had more impact.<br&gt;<br&gt;The poached eggs were not that great, to be honest. They were almost cold by the time they were served, and one out the 4 was not runny in the middle. Toasting the english muffins and grilling the tomatoes would have improved the dishes, i think.<br&gt;<br&gt;In summary, as NOM is quite out of the way for those who don&amp;#39;t live in Macpherson, I think I&amp;#39;d need a stronger reason to go back. The cakes are definitely tempting, so i&amp;#39;d stop by for those if i&amp;#39;m nearby."

Went on a Friday and surprisingly full in the late night. <br&gt;<br&gt;Many were here for the pretty rainbow cakes with assorted creams. Today is the oreo and salted caramel cream. The former is a little dry and the latter a bit too caramel sweet. But its a decent rainbow cake. not overly creamy and the colors of the layers are impressively bright. Not the best rainbow cake I ate (as of now i have tried like A LOT of them) but its up there with a couple of my faves.<br&gt;<br&gt;Savories - sweet potato fries were well done. could have a little more powdered sugar. Truffle Parmesan Fries - alright. The half and half pizza is served in its rectangular form and the crust is thin and filled with herbs (think foccacia bread). an interesting take with the pepperoni and mushroom<br&gt;with arugula. Overall not a bad pizza. The crust saved the dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;Drinks - as a coffee and chocolate lover I went for the latte which is small and decent (my girlies beg to differ, so you guys try it and let me know). I was attracted to the chocolate drinks especially with african red hot chocolate and chilli hot chocolate in the list. so we ordered them. THEY WERE NOT HOT. Lukewarm at best. *sad face. But the chilli chocolate had that spicy punch after a sip. so that was the saving grace of that. The african red chocolate had nothing to rescue it from its sad lukewarm (and by now cold) state. *sigh<br&gt;<br&gt; The service staff are friendly and one was really honest to let me and my girlies know it was her first day. Not very proactive but attentive when called. So overall not bad. a very young team of girls.<br&gt;<br&gt;For an estate like Macpherson to have such a cafe really brings a twist to the feel of the place. Will come back again to try the other things like their mains, all day breakkies (weekends only hor) and their non cake desserts. Oh they have interesting cheesecakes too. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall a very good cafe with quality food and a passionate service team. Come here before it gets popular!"

If you&amp;#39;re not interested in cold pressed juice, you can try their pure juices or some tea. Prices are okay; medium bottles start at $5.90. To be honest, I find their flavours a bit basic* (guava/pineapple/carrot, grapefruit citrus-y mixes) so I do hope they consider being more adventurous in the future.<br&gt;<br&gt;I tried their Mediterranean sandwich and it was quite nice. The flavours went well; I just wish the cheese was more evenly distributed as I thought it&amp;#39;s the one ingredient that made the sandwich.

Sure, it&amp;#39;s already there for half the day waiting for someone to buy it, but it still tastes pretty good once heated up (you can&amp;#39;t have everything).

As soon as you find a seat hostesses will sit with you and help you order but, they don&amp;#39;t take the orders. Basically their job is to hang with the customers, convince you to buy them drinks, buy yourself more drinks and they also do choreographed dances during the bands break. They aren&amp;#39;t prostitutes like most of the other businesses in the building but don&amp;#39;t think they are in love with you either.

They also have thin-crust pizzas with a variety of toppings, as well as salads, for those of us who absolutely need something green in every meal.

The rice is also fragrant especially coupled together with its sauces. The chicken rice here never fails to whet my appetite!<br&gt;<br&gt;One thing to note though is that the main boss, a old uncle in the photo, who has deep sounding voice talks like he is scolding you. He&amp;#39;s got great hairstyle but he ain&amp;#39;t that friendly uncle you wanna talk with. That&amp;#39;s why there is an assistant beside him to take your orders.

For about a $1 extra, you can add veggies. I was surprised they wrapped it up in paper but it worked. It held together until we got back to our hotel.

I almost took a taxi there but decided to use the MRT instead because it was about a 21 min drive from Lavender. So during our first day in Singapore I dragged Hubby along for a joyride to Riviera LRT. Don&amp;#39;t worry, we had never even heard about the LRT line before today but the café was within 5 minutes walking distance from the LRT.<br&gt;<br&gt;Whisk and Paddle was a popular choice for cyclist and families especially since it was a bit of a mini getaway place from the always busy city. I think a lot of people appreciate the change of scenery that they could find within the small area. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was really good and the staff was quite attentive as every customer were given glasses of cold water right as they sat down. There was a small kids&amp;#39; corner where little boys and girls can enjoy some activities using toys provided by the café. If you can&amp;#39;t bear the humidity, there is also indoor seating available for customers.<br&gt;<br&gt;One important tip: as soon as you get off the Riviera LRT, take a lift / stair down and use your google maps to locate the Punggol Police Station. Once you&amp;#39;ve found the police station, there&amp;#39;s a restaurant complex nearby (Popeye&amp;#39;s Chicken, Seafood restaurant etc and you will see the Whisk and Paddle café soon enough).<br&gt;<br&gt;FOOD<br&gt;The humid weather made hubby crave cold drinks more than usual so he ordered a glass of yellow mango smoothie. I went with the black sesame latte instead, a drink that will certainly make a person conscious of having black sesame powder stuck on their teeth after a few sips. I like my black sesame latte since it wasn&amp;#39;t too strong and it came with pretty coffee art too.<br&gt;<br&gt;We tried the Pandan Melaka waffle that came with Movenpick Vanilla Dream ice cream, cubic butter cakes, roasted cashew, gula Melaka and bits of cornflakes. Today&amp;#39;s waffle was crispy and it had a really good texture. The Madagascar vanilla icecream didn&amp;#39;t disappoint too and to be honest it was probably the best vanilla ice cream that I ever tasted! Every material worked well together and also perfect to be shared between two people. Next time I will request an extra bowl of gula Melaka ;-)."

The only thing that the stall sell is peanut pancake aka Ban Chiang Kueh. There are two types of it. One type is the big round peanut pancake where it will be cut into different equal parts. The other type is the small oval shape one.<br&gt;<br&gt;I particularly like the small oval shape one. I will usually ask the uncle for red bean flavor and sprinkle peanut over it. The red bean wasn&amp;#39;t too sweet but very generous. Peanut used will overlap the red bean. Amazingly, uncle is only selling one for 70cents. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finding the stall may be quite hard but you will be lead by the smell of peanuts and recognize the stall as it is usually filled with peanut spilled all over the counter. Whenever I am there, I will see Uncle preparing large order. People place huge order like 20 and above and you will see uncle baking the pancake nonstop. <br&gt;<br&gt;For someone like me who don&amp;#39;t usually like Peanut Pancake, I strongly recommended the stall and it deserve the 5 star. Open from Mon to Fri: 8am to 5pm"

Sustainably sourced ingredients are delicately crafted into whimsical and flavorful dishes at the restaurant in Mahota Commune. The service is also to notch and impeccable. <br&gt;<br&gt;Tip: Call ahead to make reservations especially if your party is big.<br&gt;<br&gt;I enjoyed a Heidinger pale ale poured into super chilled Steins. Then they served bread at room temperature with nutty olive oil and balsamic. At the table, there is cracked pepper and salt to dress the dip. Furthermore, there is a sauce station where you can dip your bread or accompany your meal with delicious bursts of flavor: Black sesame, pesto, ginger, tomato, konbu, And a secret Spicy Mahota blend. At the station, they also have thinly sliced chilies, minced garlic, green onion and cilantro.<br&gt;<br&gt;I chose the 9 Element Set with meat. There is also a 9 Element Set that is vegetarian.<br&gt;This tasting set arrived in a lovely wooden box with a lid. The server revealed my meal with flair. It was overwhelmingly beautiful. I ate across the rows from top to bottom, left to right. I enjoyed the cold kebab of handcrafted sausage, cantaloupe ball and grape tomato with a tangy citrus sauce. Cold cut thinly sliced roast beef with carrot filigree and caviar-like goodness. I accompanied that course with the ginger and black sesame sauces. I also enjoyed the Konbu salad and the smoke salmon. My parents shared the hot pot. Wow! The broth was super tasty after all the raw ingredients were added and enjoyed. Our table also ordered the mushroom soup that was smooth and creamy. The humongous pork knuckle was tasty and texturrific! The crackling was fabulous. Try the meat with the different sauce offering!<br&gt;<br&gt;The wait staff was always there clearing plates and making sure that there was plenty of water and other libations desired. Mahota is a great place to eat and feel good about sending love to Mother Earth!"

This would be a place for special occasions.  You pay for tasty food and excellent views.  Unfortunately, the beer wasn&amp;#39;t great, but if you stick to beer cocktails or their other selection of drinks you will be OK.  With the large price tag you want to ensure you are getting something great.<br&gt;<br&gt;The service was friendly and prompt for Singapore.  <br&gt;."

Both were very enjoyable evenings.<br&gt;<br&gt;The view from the restaurant/brewpub is quite extraordinary and is an obvious draw to LeVel33. There are other restaurants and bars with great views but you can&amp;#39;t go wrong with a visit to the bar for a cocktail or brew.<br&gt;<br&gt;In addition to the bar, there are indoor and outdoor tables. The ambiance is interesting. It&amp;#39;s  rather loud and appears to be a mix of after-work office workers and other patrons who go for the view. Overall, it&amp;#39;s very pleasant. <br&gt;<br&gt;The staff on both occasions that I visited were very friendly and attentive. Service was excellent.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s a brewhouse and restaurant in one. I tried about 4 different beers. All were good but none were special. Like the beer, the food was good but it wasn&amp;#39;t great. Unlike the beer, the food is pricey.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our steaks were cooked to order. The tenderloin was very good. The ribeye was very thin. It was definitely disappointing. I expect ribeyes to be triple the thickness of the steak that I was served. It was tasty but the flavor fell short of top notch steakhouses.<br&gt;<br&gt;My party split a Level33 Mess, which was a mess of shapes, colors, textures and flavors. It was good but nothing special. I think whoever created this dessert was trying too hard to come up with something different and unique.<br&gt;<br&gt;Prices are what you might expect for a restaurant with a view in the financial district of Singapore but not ridiculous given the restaurant&amp;#39;s decor, service, and the view.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth a visit for the view, nice ambience, and good service.

If you love eating outside and beautiful views of Singapore; make sure that reservation is outside. The views at this place are spectacular! Some of the best in the city. Now, the food is in my honest opinion, nothing to write home about. I&amp;#39;ve had a few different things off the menu and nothing ever knocked me off my feet. Last night, my wife took me here for my birthday dinner, I had the truffle linguine, she had the brewery burger. For sides we shared the roasted potatoes and the mushroom dish. The potatoes were cooked well, but were mostly bland and flavorless. The mushrooms had some taste, but still quite bland for my tastebuds. The linguine was excellent, a perfect portion that paired well with my IPA. Do not forget that this place is a Brewery, so have a beer. Leave the wine for other restaurants! The IPA was so great I had 2. I&amp;#39;m a huge IPA fan, but you can follow my reviews on Untappd, not on Yelp. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, the restaurant gets a 3 for food and a 5 for the views and the atmosphere."

There are two separate parts to LeVeL33. There is a restaurant, which caters to well-dressed office people; and a bar on the balcony, which sees casual groups of flip-flop wearing individuals in shorts, sunnies, t-shirts. I&amp;#39;m reviewing from the latter point-of-view.<br&gt;<br&gt;The balcony is just a great outdoor experience with a ~240 degree-view of Singapore. You can see visually from Fullerton Hotel -to- The Esplanade -to- the Marina Bay waterway -to- The Float -to- The Art Science Museum -to- MBS -to- Gardens by the Bay -to- Ships in Singapore Strait -to- the other towers of Marina Boulevard (and slightly beyond).<br&gt;<br&gt;The beers are interesting and tasty. I tried the IPA (quite strong and heady) and the Lager (much easier drinking) and enjoyed both. Given the location, the drinks were expensive, but this was to be expected, and I cannot fault them on pricing.<br&gt;<br&gt;However, where there is a disconnect to the bar is the lack-of-food options. There is a food menu that accompanies the drink menu, but whilst the bar opens at 11-30am, the bar food is not available until 2-30pm (I think this is because they do not want a clash with their restaurant). This 3-hour window of difference between drink-and-food ensures that if you are interested in a session you&amp;#39;ll have to basically go elsewhere because you&amp;#39;ll be drunk well before 2-30pm arrives.<br&gt;<br&gt;This is exactly what our crew did (there was 8 of us). We were 3-4 drinks in, and needed food to accompany any further alcohol, and since there was a significant wait ahead of us, we decided to leave and go elsewhere despite this location being fantastic.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service *appears* to be patchy. Before arriving, one of our team was reporting that service was very slow, whilst upon my arrival I had no trouble gaining the attention of servers whenever my beer was running low. So this might be something to think about when it gets busy (it wasn&amp;#39;t very busy when we were there).<br&gt;<br&gt;I feel like this bar is a must-visit, even if you just come up for 1-2 drinks and enjoy the view (take a video or a pano) then head back down. For tourists it&amp;#39;s literally 30 minutes of your day to capture an incredible view of the city and won&amp;#39;t cost you an arm-and-a-leg like MBS does. <br&gt;<br&gt;NB: LeVeL33 has its own lift in Tower 1 of Marina Boulevard, and is located to the very left-hand side past the Standard Chartered signage. You cannot miss the LeVeL33 signage, once you see that, the lift is located in the alcove next to it."

Well,  I was a bit disappointed with the food as it  was just &amp;#39;ok&amp;#39;. We ordered the Pig &amp;amp; Ssnail and Hokkaido Scallop for starters. The starters were fine. Unique mixture of the cream sauce blended well with the pork belly. The scallop was much nicer, again with good blending with the cream sauce. As for the mains, we ordered the Jumbo Prawns and Australian Bangalow Pork. The presentation was great but the they tasted as I mentioned earlier &amp;#39;ok&amp;#39; only. They were pretty plain and &amp;#34;not enticing&amp;#34;. The portion was more than enough for the both of us. As for the desserts, the mini chocolate lava cake was good. Not so much the same for the rest of the chocolate stuffs. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, their service. I must say the service was excellent. The staffs were firendly and they replace new clean plates after each course. <br&gt;<br&gt;In conclusion, if you are going there for the ambiance and the beer, that   would be a great place to go.

They labelled themselves as the &amp;#34;world highest urban craft brewery&amp;#34; and man, actually the view up here is splendid! Take the inside seats facing outdoors, as it&amp;#39;s really not that chill after all staying outdoors in this 365 summer Singapore.<br&gt;<br&gt;I chanced upon a post by a friend on the Saturday brunch buffet and decided to give it a try for my big boy&amp;#39;s birthday. It&amp;#39;s a minimalist brunch compared to the hotels buffet we usually come across, which I like about it as the selection is small but great individually! We made reservation through a 3rd party app, and the staff called to confirm my reservation the day before. On Saturday itself, we were held up by some errands on the morning which we called to delay our reservations twice, and the staff responded positively to our request and I&amp;#39;m truly thankful for that!<br&gt;<br&gt;The selection are very clear in 1 small confined area. Cold selection, hot selection, cheese, soup, desserts. That&amp;#39;s all we&amp;#39;ve got. There&amp;#39;s nothing international about the Saturday brunch. Cold selection includes salami, some seafood, salad. Hot selection includes foei gras, mini eggs ben, mini blue cheese quiche tartlets, roast beef, sausages, and 2 more dishes I couldn&amp;#39;t recall. Desserts and cheeses are cluttered at one corner. Well, I&amp;#39;ll pass the soup next time. Soup served on that day was a tomato relish sort of soup (well it&amp;#39;s not labelled), and it tasted super salty which I stopped after 2 mouthfuls. There&amp;#39;s also a selection of bread which you can choose to go with it. Apart from the soup, I love how all the rest are served so nicely.<br&gt;<br&gt;The highlight of the brunch is definitely their craft beers, beer cocktails, and special beer cocktails of the month! It&amp;#39;s your a hardcore beer drinker, you can opt to top it up for the &amp;#34;beer buffet&amp;#34; version from the normal buffet price of $58++. Alternatively, you can order the beer separately. For a brewery, buffet and beer combination is definitely the way to go!<br&gt;<br&gt;One of the nays will probably go to the service. Staff do not give you much attention and you just gotta try your best to wave hard, or go up to them. My plates are not cleared promptly, neither was my water filled. I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s the privacy time which they are trying to give us, or they simply don&amp;#39;t care. However, they are not rude la, still can make it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, the view up here is a true win! We enjoyed the lovely view over brunch, which makes our Saturday slow paced and relaxed. They also live up to their name as a brewery for the tasty draft they served! It was an enjoyable weekend brunch which I&amp;#39;ll be back again."

I went there mainly to try the beer, since back home in Bellingham WA, we have several craft breweries. <br&gt;<br&gt;I tried all 6 of there beers, 5 via a beer flight.

There food looked delicious, all I had was a salad and their mushroom flight. Things started adding up fast so I didn&amp;#39;t get a main course.

But it&amp;#39;s no better than what you&amp;#39;d find in a 7-11 or such.<br&gt;<br&gt;One thing that&amp;#39;s worth coming here for is the awesome view! And furthermore, the light show going on right across the water is one great thing to watch while you&amp;#39;re here soaking in the backdrop. They didn&amp;#39;t lie when they said it was the world&amp;#39;s highest brewery at 33 levels above ground. <br&gt;<br&gt;Don&amp;#39;t come here with hopes that you&amp;#39;ll get a good beer craving satisfied. There are plenty of other places in town that offer better tasting beer just in bottles. But it&amp;#39;s totally worth it to come just for the view alone, which makes up for their average tasting brewskies."

There are so many better places for the price (and even for cheaper). I was very unimpressed with the food. The Ploughman&amp;#39;s Board had a TON of meat, but no cheese or veggies and not enough bread/crackers - we didn&amp;#39;t even get halfway through it despite having about 10 men in their 20s in the group! The Seafood Medley had a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; selection of seafood. The shrimp was good and that was about it. The wine and foie gras were good, but nothing special. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out medium. It was too chewy, but it was flavorful.<br&gt;<br&gt;SERVICE: SUBPAR: This is some of the slowest and inattentive service I&amp;#39;ve ever had. We asked for water several times to several different waiters before half our table got water - and then the other half about 10 minutes later. I ordered a glass of wine, which was delivered to another woman in our party at the opposite end of the table - and it was only when I asked where mine was 20 minutes after ordering it that they said they had already given it to me.... except they had given it to her. <br&gt;<br&gt;AMBIANCE: GREAT: Topnotch luxury with a great view and beautiful interior. Very fancy."

There&amp;#39;s an elevator within the financial building that goes directly to the venue.<br&gt;<br&gt;We got the craft beer sampler, with 5 samples of their own beers, then got more based on what we liked. Overall, the beers were alright. I liked the blond. I did not like the stout or the mixed stout with the pale ale, which they said was one of the beers. Lots of color but not much flavor. I know Singapore has high alcohol taxes, but you think for like $20 the beer would be better than that.<br&gt;<br&gt;Anyways, a nice hangout spot, if a bit expensive.

Level 33 is a less crowded option with a spectacular view of the marina.  You can see at night random flashes from people&amp;#39;s cameras at the merlion to the amazing laser light show of marina bay sands. Only part I mark off is that the staff assumed I was just their to enjoy the view and did not order my beer until I was pretty much ready to leave. But wow what a view. Go at night. You can see the heart of Singapore just buzzing from the 33rd story.  You see the lights of the garden by the bay and with Such a beautiful view. I forgot I needed a beer to enjoy myself. So where I would normally give a 2 I give this place a four.  Rule of real estate. Location location location and man what a location.

The view is quite spectacular but nothing compared to MBS or One Altitude of course. the food was decent for its price. it&amp;#39;s handcrafted beers were ok but we had better.

They said no charge.  Of course, it ended up on the bill.  When I pointed it out the guy went back to fix it.  When he came back the charge was still on because he had &amp;#34;called his manager and his manager had said that we had ordered one in the first round and the other in the 2nd round.&amp;#34;  There were no two rounds so I&amp;#39;m not sure if the server was lying or the &amp;#39;manager&amp;#39; he called but regardless I said it wasn&amp;#39;t acceptable and to take it off the bill.  He came back with it off but what is with that?  And then when we were paying cash and sorting it out, he was like &amp;#34;don&amp;#39;t you think it&amp;#39;d be easier to put on your card?&amp;#34;  Felt very odd he was trying to force a credit card transaction.  The whole end was sketchy and ruined what had been a good night.  Unacceptable service."

Sometimes the balcony gets rather crowded but usually you can get a table after 20-30 minute wait or can always enjoy the view and come back inside for drinks.

Starters: <br&gt;- Fresh rolls with 3 different types of butter (love butter!!!)<br&gt;- Scallop (my favorite) &amp;amp; pork belly <br&gt;- Foie gras (excellent &amp;amp; Normally, I don&amp;#39;t like this dish but this one was good. Whatever else I write will be an understatement for foie gras lovers so I&amp;#39;ll stop here. <br&gt;<br&gt;2. Mains: <br&gt;- Overall, quite disappointing especially after the spectacular starters. I have a feeling that this place excels in its niche - starters/finger food/desserts &amp;amp; (of course) cocktails/beers. However, not in their mains.  <br&gt;- The pan fried sea bass had a fishy smell that was not musk well which really irks me. Another big downer was that the fillet had so much small-annoying-hard-to-see bones in it. Beware! It was a chore to debone it and isn&amp;#39;t worth the effort because it wasn&amp;#39;t even that tasty to begin with. <br&gt;- Beef. I ordered mine medium-well. A precarious task because as most restaurants do not do this well. It comes often comes out over cooked (well-done). Level 33 was no exception. Also, they topped the steak with a strong cheese (melted on top of it) which really overpowered the flavor of the steak. The steak sauce was great but they gave too little of it, and whilst I tried to ration my meat to sauce ratio carefully in the end the sauce ran out before the meat. <br&gt;<br&gt;3. Desserts: <br&gt;- Chocolate lava cake - Good! I love who they balanced out the sweetness of the chocolate with sea salt and cream cheese at the side. <br&gt;- Mascarpone - Great!!! even though they got our order wrong! We were suppose to have the banana dessert (whatever that was, it was recommended by our server) but this was excellent! I am a big fan of mascarpone so I might be biased. If you like cheesey-sweet treats like me, this one is definitely for you! <br&gt;<br&gt;4. Drinks: <br&gt;- Excellent. I am not a big fan of beer. In fact, I NEVER order it. However, this microbrewery has changed my opinion. All their cocktails are beer based (I believe) and they were sooo good (with the exception of the stout. I am still, and forever will be NOT A FAN OF STOUT. The bitterness puts me off.) Even the plain beer alone is good. It has a really light taste, even lighter than Heikien.<br&gt;- Paris - Love x2! Very sweet though. <br&gt;- Blond mojito - Love x3. My favorite drink. <br&gt;- Beer - Love<br&gt;- Unknown stout cocktail with berries - Cannot Love, because of my predisposition to be biased against stout!!! The bf thought it was ok though. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Service <br&gt;- Good. The waiter was kind enough to throw in 2 free drinks. The first because I hinted it looked good. The second because our desserts took 45min to come. <br&gt;- Really appreciated their effort to be efficient. <br&gt;- They had a pre-set the dining table with a rose &amp;amp; a box of chocolates so definitely good news for the guys. Half the work has already been done for you. <br&gt;<br&gt;The View<br&gt;- It was AWESOME. Overlooking the entire marina bay :) How singapore has grown. I feel old already! <br&gt;- It&amp;#39;s a bit chilly up there so definitely bring a jacket along. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall: Will definitely be back here again with friends to grab a cocktail &amp;amp; snack on some starters."

This is the first plate of Risotto that I didn&amp;#39;t like, I am normally a huge fan of Risotto.<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s waffle time! Despite the unsatisfying experience with the main courses, I was so certain the highly instagrammable waffles with ice cream would be the highlight of my night!<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Waffles with Mao shan wang durian and belgian chocolate $18.50+<br&gt;I liked that the durian ice cream colour wasn&amp;#39;t overly yellow, which a lot of ice cream parlours, normally add yellow colouring to, it didn&amp;#39;t smell very fragrant but it tasted good. I liked the durian ice cream. The Belgian chocolate tasted okay, it didn&amp;#39;t leave an impression for me. The waffles, which I was looking forward to, tasted ok, I&amp;#39;ve definitely had better waffles in the surrounding area.<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Waffles with Pulut Hitam and Pistacchio $18.50+<br&gt;The only redeeming factor that Chatper 55 had for me tonight, was the Pulut Hitam ice cream, which I truly enjoyed. However not all the girls at my table liked it. It wasn&amp;#39;t displayed, but they had it in the freezer. You could bite into the black rice bits in the ice cream. It a legit, pulut hitam ice cream! The Pistacchio was also a memorable ice cream flavour. You can distinctively taste the pistacchio.<br&gt;The bill for 6 girls and we weren&amp;#39;t very big eaters, so asking all 6 of us to order a main course each isn&amp;#39;t the wisest cafe policy, even from a business stand point.<br&gt;<br&gt;The staff weren&amp;#39;t well organized and took a long while to clear our table. The first staff cleared one plate, and a male staff cleard 2 more plates. We were done with all our plates and when the waffles came, we still had half a table worth of dirty plates. Only after the second waffle came to our table, did another male staff who served us the waffles, clear the rest of the dirty dishes.<br&gt;<br&gt;The chinese local lady at the cashier who spoke mandarin was very friendly and polite. I had higher hopes for their ice cream and waffles with such a high price tag on each plate. <br&gt;<br&gt;On the bright side, they have BOGO weekday lunch offers.<br&gt;<br&gt;wifi password : chapter55"

So today, despite the heavy afternoon rain, we walked from our office to sought out the place. Walking along Eng Hoon Street, the restaurant was easily noticeable by the corner of Tiong Poh Road. It&amp;#39;s pretty big. One thing that I found very attractive on their signboard was how they highlighted their &amp;#34;1 for 1 on weekdays&amp;#34; offer.<br&gt;<br&gt;We went as a group of 5. Seeing that the restaurant is not Halal-certified, I couldn&amp;#39;t try out their main courses, hence I went with the desserts. Like one of the popular quotes that I snapped stated, &amp;#34;Life is short. Eat dessert first!&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;The appetizers came as bowls of mushroom soup. The mushrooms weren&amp;#39;t in chunky forms but they were grounded in, which was nice!<br&gt;<br&gt;Two of my colleagues ordered one plate of white wine pasta (Vongole?) and the other, some sort of seafood pasta. Can&amp;#39;t recall the names of the dishes, but both of them commented that the spices in both of their pastas were too overpowering; one even masked the white wine sauce. They also ordered buffalo wings (5 pieces). Personally, from what I see, those wings were overpriced. Such small pieces for $16?!<br&gt;<br&gt;Came my Salted Caramel Waffle and a glass of Black Cow. Funny names to give the floats: &amp;#34;Black Cow&amp;#34; for Coke Float and &amp;#34;Snow White&amp;#34; for Sprite Float. <br&gt;<br&gt;Well, as you can see from my waffle photo, I just loved the presentation. What a plating! Loved how they stenciled in cocoa powder of their logo at the corner of the plate. The waffle itself cost me $17 due to the fact that I opted for 2 scoops of ice-cream. Otherwise it would have been $15 for one. I opted for a scoop of Salted Caramel and Hazelnut gelato on my waffle, while I got another scoop of Hersheys gelato for my coke float. Loved the waffle!<br&gt;<br&gt;We even sampled a teaspoon of some of the gelatos on display. I had the Salted Egg flavoured, Cotton Candy flavoured and Strawberry Cheesecake flavoured... Nice. But definitely, I have tasted better and creamier gelatos elsewhere."

We ordered buffalo wings to share, I remember it being decent but not particularly authentic but on the spicy side.  The dish that blew me away was one of their fresh pasta dishes. The sauce was AMAZING, it is very flavorful and seems to be saffron based.  The seafood was very fresh, which is quite a rarity when eating out and reflects their attentiveness in sourcing ingredients.  It is also very reasonably priced.  To be honest, it was really out of my expectations.  I later read from other reviews that the chef is from Pasta Brava - that explains it.  Also read that its owner is the same as Ice Edge Cafe, a popular cafe in Kovan (ok too far for me so good they open one in TB). I tried a piece of the pizza that my friend was having, the crust was pretty good too.  The pasta was really filling as the sauce was so rich, so I didn&amp;#39;t have any room for desserts.   That is a pity though as they appears to serve a great selection of gelatos.   I read that they have a 1-for-1 pasta deal during weekday lunch time and that&amp;#39;s a pretty good deal, I would totally take advantage of this if I work around Tiong Bahru.  This is a pretty big space and can accommodate any group dining comfortably."

This is a typical brunch restaurant. I don&amp;#39;t see where it&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;hip&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;ster&amp;#39;.<br&gt;<br&gt;Food is average. Mushroom soup is not Campbell&amp;#39;s.

The only thing I would come back for are the pizzas, Super thin crust and light. Nice.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ambience is homely. Lots of wood benches and tin pails for decoration. Seats are tightly packed and walk space is narrow. I might have seen a mason jar or two. /shudder<br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;Will I come back?&amp;#34; Yes, for the pizza and for the &amp;#34;buy 1 get one free&amp;#34; lunch special. Now the mechanics of this BOGO is dreadfully complicated and very sneaky if the customer is not careful. I will explain this in the next section. This would have been so easy to fix when asked, and would have won a life-long customer. But. hey, which restaurant manager would want to do that?<br&gt;<br&gt;Service is non-existent. Poor guys are overworked and do not have time for pleasantries. <br&gt;<br&gt;Price. Ahhh, the only thing this place has going for it is the 1 for 1 lunch special. When you get seated, you will see from the menu that not all items qualify for this. Items that do, have a little label next to it.<br&gt;<br&gt;So! Imagine the following scenario:<br&gt;<br&gt;Ah Beng and Ah Lian decide to try this new &amp;#39;simi-lai eh hipster&amp;#39; cafe near Ah Mah&amp;#39;s flat in Tiong Bahru.<br&gt;<br&gt;They order two muchroom soups ($11 for 2) This items is automatically 1 for 1. Don&amp;#39;t know why they have to make life so confusing.<br&gt;<br&gt;Then Ah Beng orders a Vogole pasta MAIN for $18. Ah Lian orders a Funghi Pizza for $18.<br&gt;<br&gt;For appetisers, Ah Beng orders Buffalo Wings ($16) and Ah Lian orders Calamari Rings ($16).<br&gt;<br&gt;So, quick recap: 2 soups, 2 mains, 2 appetisers.<br&gt;<br&gt;QUESTION: How much was Ah Beng and Ah Lian charged for their lunch? (Assume no service charge.)<br&gt;<br&gt;ANSWER: You would think, this is easy! <br&gt;1 for 1 mushroom soup + 1 for 1 MAIN + 1 for 1 appetiser = $11 + $18 + $16 = $45<br&gt;<br&gt;Wrong. Because Chapter 55 is so scared that customers will &amp;#39;take advantage&amp;#39; of the 1 for 1 deal, this is how they calculated the bill:<br&gt;<br&gt;Mushroom soup is $11 for 2. (Written in the menu, don&amp;#39;t argue.)<br&gt;Higher cost items are charged, lower cost items are free. (Written in the fine print, don&amp;#39;t argue.)<br&gt;<br&gt;Actual bill is: $11 + $18 + $18 = $47<br&gt;<br&gt;Ah Beng and Ah Lian pays up and leaves, vowing to never come back and also something about mothers and fathers.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ok, ok, the story is a little dramatic for a difference of $2. But it is the principle of the whole thing. Even if it is not for principle, then it is about making a quick decision to make Ah Lian and Ah Beng happy customers. <br&gt;<br&gt;Long story short: After the trauma of mathematics and Chapter 55. Ah Beng and Ah Lian grew closer and lived happily ever after,"

My favourite dish last time was always his char kway teow. Little did I know how famous he was until now. <br&gt;<br&gt;After moving away from Bukit Merah at the age of 6, occasionally, we&amp;#39;ll go back to visit my grandparents&amp;#39; old friends at the temple nearby and the char kway teow uncle (as I used to call him). Recently, my dad had a craving for his char kway teow and we went back to eat it. However, the uncle has slimmed down quite a fair bit due to his age and he doesn&amp;#39;t recognize me now as it has been a good 10 years or so since I have ate his char kway teow. He does recall my grandparents though. <br&gt;<br&gt;So this time, instead of being the bratty kid that I was who only wanted his char kway teow with eggs and no beansprout, lard and cockles (which he always used to prepare for me as a child) I ordered it without removing anything and with chili. I took a photo of it and went on Instagram and Twitter promote it as my childhood favourite dish.. and out of curiousity I decided to google his store&amp;#39;s name. To my pleasant surprise, I found out that he was actually one of the last great char kway teow men (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieatishootipost.sg%2F2010%2F11%2Fsheng-cheng-char-kway-teow-last-of-char.html&amp;amp;s=3a22897715d0e309e7bb6e2fb414d81cc94c38a2f8f3659207bbe6d9c3a546c2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""&gt;ieatishootipost.sg/2010/…</a&gt;). Only then I realised how important this plate is because well, in a melodramatic sense, you can&amp;#39;t get good and nostalgic char kway teow like this anymore. So in a way, this is a heritage dish. So if you happen to be around Blk 132 Jalan Bukit Merah, do pop by this store and order a plate of his char kway teow."

This stall has been around for ages, run by an old auntie and uncle. When they aren&amp;#39;t hard at work with the wok, you&amp;#39;ll catch them preparing their ingredients throughout the day. <br&gt;<br&gt;Situated in a fairly non-descript coffee shop, Sheng Chen char kway teow is located in a small hole-in-the-wall units beneath a HDB block. Nonetheless, they&amp;#39;ve managed to garner quite a loyal fanbase, as evidenced by the trickle of maids streaming in for takeaway orders, and the fair number of newspaper cuttings displayed. I really enjoyed the cripsy pork lard, as well as the fresh cockles, freshly shucked every morning by the auntie. It had just the right about of chilli, and the firmness of the noodles was just right (though some might prefer it a little softer). <br&gt;<br&gt;At $2.50 a plate, it&amp;#39;s a sinful treat on the cheap. While paling in comparison to the epoch of char kway teow that is Hill Street in Bedok, this is definitely one of the best traditional wok-fried versions you&amp;#39;ll find in the south of Singapore."

Chicken was super crispy and very well cooked (not as in &amp;#34;well-done overcooked&amp;#34;) but executed well and turning out crispy, light, and tasty. The curry was so-so, good enough to go back for, but not good enough that I&amp;#39;d highlight it as a MUST TRY.

While this reduces the amount of meat on each wing, it does make it really easy to eat. The crumb-coating on the wings is a little bit salty though, but if you just eat one or two, it&amp;#39;s really quite tasty, and they&amp;#39;re really crispy. Salt factor is the only point they could improve on. <br&gt;<br&gt;Beyond that, nothing really left an impression. It&amp;#39;s a stable place. Better than 2 stars, not really solidly three.

We overheard the staff saying that the waiting time was about half an hour. Fortunately, we&amp;#39;d made a reservation, so we practically sailed right past the waiting line. <br&gt;<br&gt;I like the atmosphere of the cafe. It was open, inviting and bustling with activity. Perfect place for people-watching. We were seated on the balcony facing the stables. My initial concern was about the smell, but it was unnoticeable. <br&gt;<br&gt;We had the corned beef croquettes, Riders Burger, and homemade sausages with creme fraiche scrambled eggs. The croquettes were good - the crispy, golden brown breadcrumbs gave way to creamy potatoes with the occasional chewy beef bits. The corned beef offered a pleasant pop of flavour that accented the mild potato taste. They were truly enjoyable to eat. The portion was generous too. I expected maybe two pieces of croquettes but there were four - more than enough for a starter. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Riders Burger was all about the beef. The other ingredients were reminciscent of Burger King&amp;#39;s Western Whopper, but they were all overwhelmed by the beef. This burger would be perfect for meat lovers.<br&gt;<br&gt;I chose the homemade sausages and creme fraiche scrambled eggs because they came with a leek and potato rosti. Unfortunately they looked better than they tasted. The hollandaise sauce was the best part of the dish. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and creamy, but for the most part tasteless, but that was ok as we had salt and pepper at our table. The rosti was, strangely, creamy. It was essentially fried mashed potato and leek. There was a mild taste of leek on the fried surface, but that was overpowered by the flavourless mush that was underneath. Next to the mild flavours of the eggs and mush, the sausage tasted too strong, which shocks the taste buds. I dipped most of what I could in the hollandaise to get some flavour, but there was barely a spoonful of it to begin with. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food may have been slightly disappointing, but the service was excellent. The crew was attentive and proactive, and we could really tell that they were properly trained to provide high-level service. For that, kudos to the staff AND the owner/management of Riders Cafe for caring. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service really contributes half, if not more, to customer experience and satisfaction. For this, I would definitely go back to Riders (and order other things on the menu instead)."

They do take walk in customers but likely you just have to wait for at least 30 minutes or more. It is not so bad as you get to gaze at the lush greenery, clear blue sky (if it is not raining) and listen to the neighing and clopping of horses every time they are led back into the stables. Quite enjoyable as it is not a common sight in this concrete jungle.<br&gt;<br&gt;Being my 2nd visit in a span of a few years, I am glad the food is still as good. <br&gt;<br&gt;We shared the pacific benedict and brioche french toast with bananas. They were excellent. <br&gt;<br&gt;Quite a generous serving of swimmer crab meat with nicely poached eggs and spinach and shrimp hollandaise (couldn&amp;#39;t taste the shrimp) sauce. Something different from the usual egg benedict or eggs royale. <br&gt;<br&gt;The soft brioche made a perfect french toast. Loved the grilled banana caramelized with a thin layer of sugar, crispy bacon and maple syrup. <br&gt;<br&gt;The cafe mocha was also decent. <br&gt;<br&gt;Being a full house, service was a bit slow but not as bad as some places. There is no air conditioning throughout, except for the washrooms below stairs, adding to the charm of a rustic setting with fresh air coming in through the verandah. <br&gt;<br&gt;Note: You need a car or taxi to get to the restaurant."

Fortunately and coincidentally, there was a table cancellation when I called on the previous day of visit and so we did not have much problems securing seats. <br&gt;<br&gt;The usual brunch suspects were delicious and certainly lived up to the predominantly positive comments that were aplenty in the media or online community. <br&gt;<br&gt;Brioche French Toast with Fresh Berries and Vanilla Mascarpone $14 are great for those who like to start the day on a sweet note. The alternative french toast option comes with maple butter, smoked bacon and burnt bananas. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unlike &amp;#34;The Usual&amp;#34; ($16), Black stone Benedict ($15) comes with the extra hollandaise sauce on poached eggs and crispy bacon instead of bangers and mushrooms.To me, hollandaise sauce is the supporting cast that makes the leading cast (soft poached eggs with bursting egg yolk) shine. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had been tempted all along to challenge the Death by Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice cream $12 but I was disillusioned eventually. This won by quantity and not quality. The chocolate ganache was not velvety and stood unmoving like a rubbery coating. There was not much contrast in the taste because everything from the cake to the ice cream was cloyingly sweet. <br&gt;<br&gt;Instead, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake with Crumbled Honeycomb $8 would attract one to take a second bite or even more. The cheesecake itself tasted as natural as it could get, without too much sugar added. Would be ideal if there is more of the salted caramel frosting. <br&gt;<br&gt;Special items of the day are written on the black board. Even though many other brunch spots and cafe have sprouted incessantly in Singapore, Riders Cafe is a good option for brunch or even dinner with the accompaniment of horses. But the location is only convenient if you can find your way there in a car or by a taxi."

Not too bad, considering you can wait in the car until they call you.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had the poached egg, portobello, sweet corn polenta and it was cooked very nicely. It&amp;#39;s a very simple dish but the execution was very good. Another dish that we had was the almond-granola crusted fried chicken. I think the crispness of the almond &amp;amp; granola matches very well as a batter for the fried chicken. I must note that they also served the corn polenta in this dish, too repetitive IMO.<br&gt;<br&gt;We also ordered the roasted pork belly and it was the letdown of the meal. It was such a sin to cook a pork that way.

Rocked up on a Saturday for brunch one weekend. I didn&amp;#39;t have a booking, and Im not too sure if they take brunch bookings, though had to wait for a wee bit to get a table on the verandah. No air con in this place, though they have done well to make sure it quite comfortable and airy. Straight forward comforting food here, think shepherd&amp;#39;s pie, beef burger, eggs ben etc etc. Well priced items, freshly squeezed orange juice always wins extra brownie points in my books. Had the shepherd&amp;#39;s pie which was ok, would of gone down better if it was perhaps made in the classical way with mince lamb as opposed to braising diced lamb.  Service, at least the young girl who served or table had to be one of the cheeriest I&amp;#39;ve had in Singapore."

I brought it back to the guy behind the counter (he looks like an ah beng but was so gentle and soft-spoken! Surprise!) and asked if he could add more ice as it was too sweet. Without a word, he proceeded to add more ice and even top up our tea! I was shocked! He then passed me the cup and said that he added more tea &amp;#39;on the house&amp;#39; to balance the flavour. This is what I call excellent pro-activeness and good service!<br&gt;<br&gt;The only downside (that&amp;#39;s why my review is 4 stars!) was that they still give plastic cups/straws even though customers opted to dine in. They should, perhaps, consider glass cups and steel straws/or no straw policy."

The cakes are dense and feel a bit dry.<br&gt;<br&gt;What I like about the place is the relative quietness compared to the more hip and happening Tiong Bahru (Yong Siak and surrounds) area. This place has a bit of family run feel to it with its limited menu serving local food with a twist. The decor is simple and minimalist, with some likening it to a Muji-like ambience with its use of aluminium and wood. Pots of plants on the table and around the place does make it a bit homely too.<br&gt;<br&gt;A bit of background on this place from what I have read in the news and from friends living in the area. It used to be a stationery store for decades and now the grandchildren have taken over the premise by turning it into a small cafe. According to the media, the grandchildren pay rent to their grandpa who still owns the place. I thought that is a nice touch, plus the shop still stays in the family. <br&gt;<br&gt;Besides cakes (probably outsourced from other place) and beverages, you can get local delights such as yam cake, glutinous rice, laksa, curry chicken rice and fried chicken wings (I read some are made with their family recipes). The typical kaya toast with soft boiled eggs has been changed to kaya with clotted cream. Mmmm....clotted cream. Besides kaya, you can also choose lemon curd or fruit jam. There are also regular basic ham and cheese sandwiches and simple pizza for savory food.<br&gt;<br&gt;If I live in this area, it will make a pretty great spot to chill with a cup of coffee. It is not overly crowded for now. Tables are spaced out nicely that you do not feel claustrophobic or that you can accidentally eavesdrop on others&amp;#39; conversation."

It&amp;#39;s simple and gets you that kaya toast, a poached egg, and that cup of kopi. The kaya toast is pretty respectable with the sweet kaya jam made form coconut, pandan, sugar, and eggs. Dip the crisp bread into the soft poached eggs to bring that saltiness to contrast the sweet flavors of the jam.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service is pretty good and the wait isn&amp;#39;t very long as they briskly made your order and the price pretty reasonable.

The French toast was cut into bite size pieces and served with a rather sweet, thick caramel sauce. The egg was lightly poached, but broken up so that the yolk was floating in the water.

The shop opens as early as 7-8am.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for fresh scallops in amounts equalling or exceeding 0.5kg, Jim Foods deals with high-quality frozen scallops (I had a quote of $18 for half a kg). You should call ahead in the morning (maybe 8am or so) to check if they have them available before you head down. On one occasion, I called at 11am and they said they had run out. On another occasion, I reached the place at around 8.45am and the person there told me that availability for scallops was never an issue. In light of contradictory evidence, it&amp;#39;s best you play safe and call first!"

But because they&amp;#39;re so famous, make sure you have reservation prior or be prepared to wait. There are 2 outlets around Orchard Road vicinity - one at Mandarin Gallery (first outlet) and they accept no reservation, so you&amp;#39;ll have to pray hard there is no queue and the second outlet - at Scotts Square has bigger dining area capacity and accepts reservation. My favorite is always their second outlet at Scotts Square as the sitting area is more spread out and the verandah sitting area has the best natural light for you food &amp;#34;pornographers&amp;#34; out there.<br&gt;<br&gt;Their menu has been the same since I visited 2.5 years ago until today. That&amp;#39;s pretty unacceptable in Singapore since the dining scene is always fast paced and people always crave for something different from time to time. But it got me thinking, the main reasons that they&amp;#39;re maintaining their stellar items in the menu is probably because it still sells like hotcakes? The superstar items like the Tunisian (baked eggs with chorizo in thick tomato sauce) or their perfectly poached eggs benny that we won&amp;#39;t get bored eating or the simple-yet-so-delicious French toast that we crave. If one main isn&amp;#39;t enough to fill you up (for my case all the time), consider getting &amp;#34;small plates&amp;#34; of chorizo, sautéed mushroom, bacon and the likes. They have a long list of items under this section for you to mix and match to your liking.<br&gt;<br&gt;Looking at the lack of good cafés around Orchard road area, Wild Honey will always be my to go place if I need a good brunch spot knowing that they&amp;#39;re always consistent with their quality and portion."

Pricewise, it&amp;#39;s rather pricey (bout $30/pax) but portion is quite generous. We ordered the English breakfast and the Boulevard St Michel and it was delicious. I like the fact that jn both of our dishes, they successfully poached the eggs so it has firm whites but runny yolks which I adore. I also liked that they serve our dishes at the same time and are responsive whenever we call them although it was a busy day. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unfortunately, the coffee was a rather let down. We ordered the cold brew coffee but too bad it tasted more like your ordinary cup of joe on ice. I may be a bit of coffee snob but I believe cold brew should be slightly stronger and more aromatic. Nevertheless, my friend, whom is not a coffee drinker, enjoys it. So i guess it depends on your preferences.<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, i would recommend this place to people who seeks for a good brunch at central location. I would advice you to reserve your seats as it may be hard to get a seat, unless you don&amp;#39;t mind sitting at the bar, facing the columns."

I must say from the get-go, its popularity is warranted. <br&gt;<br&gt;Location wise it is the most convenient to get to - minutes away from Orchard MRT station, with bus stops closeby and the Grand Hyatt taxi stand at your disposal next door - it was a breeze getting there.<br&gt;<br&gt;Without the foresight of making a reservation, we were told it would be a half an hour wait at 11.30am on a Sunday, during which we decided to have coffee in the basement below. Their technologically advanced waiting list system was impressive. A few taps on the iPad located at their entrance, I was 7th in line and I received a call on my mobile, informing to choose if I would be there immediately or needed at 10 minute extension. A &amp;#39;service&amp;#39; I was particularly fond of.<br&gt;<br&gt;Jumpin right in, we were seated outdoors (you can indicate preferences on the iPad), and it being my first time, I took about 5-7 minutes to decide what I wanted whilst we were served water and the orange juice I ordered (Which was fresh, not too sour, good job once again). I decided on the &amp;#39;Scandinavian&amp;#39;, which is grilled salmon fillet on potato rosti, chargrilled asparagus &amp;amp; homemade Hollandaise sauce. It was right on the money,  approximate $25 bucks if I recall correctly. Salmon was grilled to perfection and the rosti was crispy (I am used to it being less crispy, but it clearly said &amp;#39;crisp rosti&amp;#39; on the menu so I guess it was done right). Do note it takes about 15-20 minutes to prepare, so if you feel like having this, get your order out right as you are seated. <br&gt; <br&gt;My friend ordered the &amp;#39;Norwegian&amp;#39; which consisted avocado, grilled asparagus spears, two perfectly poached eggs wrapped with imported Norwegian smoked salmon, homemade Hollandaise &amp;amp; salmon pearls on a whole-wheat brioche. It looked fantastic, and he isn&amp;#39;t too expressive about food but just gave me a thumbs up and a sigh of satisfaction when he was done.<br&gt;<br&gt;Definitely coming back here for more. Service was great, a little too crowded for my liking but then again, Singapore is getting that way and perhaps making reservations in advance would save you unnecessary delays. Another great brunch menu checked off my list!"

No need to queue and you are guaranteed a table when you arrive! As this outlet is also larger, you wont have the issue of tables being too close to the next so you have more privacy when dining.

Two perfectly poached eggs, sauteed mushrooms and prosciutto on toasted homemade brioche and hollandaise sauce. This has to be my favorite dish of all time. I always end up ordering this even though i always say i wanna try something new. Anyway, i think that the Mandarin Gallery branch does it better? Somehow the bread is over toasted and was too crunchy. Pretty dry. :(<br&gt;<br&gt;The Wild Mocha Dolce is my poison. This is intensely sweet but packs in some serious caffeine. I always get super high after drinking this. Friends know not to feed me with too much coffee/tea because i&amp;#39;d be bouncing off the walls. <br&gt;<br&gt;I also love the scones at WH. For tea, i like to have their cranberry scone with a cuppa of hot mocha dolce. This has to be one of the better scones in town. I&amp;#39;d put it in the same category as Foster&amp;#39;s (another of my favorite). The exterior is crispy and the middle is dense and moist. I&amp;#39;ll gently coat it with a thin layer of butter and sprinkle sea salt flakes on it- my very own version of salted butter (because WH doesn&amp;#39;t provide salted ones). Yummy! And their fresh compote of berries to go with it. Perfecto.<br&gt;<br&gt;I would be hanging out at the SS branch more often for the following reasons<br&gt;1. Wider desserts selection<br&gt;According to the manager, the kitchen at SS is 3 times bigger than that at MG. Therefore, more space to make pastries! I tried the sour cherry strudel when i was there recently (not fantastic) and they also have more tea cakes and stuff. :) I&amp;#39;ll be sure to try more desserts soon.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. More breathing space! I always felt that the MG store was really claustrophobic! In fact, the entire MG feels that way. I feel like i can easily touch the ceiling (ok i exaggerate). Also, because of the small size of the place, i do feel like i can&amp;#39;t stay on for too long even though i just wanna chill out with my book sometimes. Scotts is more airy and there&amp;#39;s more natural light hence the relaxed ambience. <br&gt;<br&gt;So if you haven&amp;#39;t tried WH (quite impossible IMO), do head on down. All day breakfast means that you never have to wake up early! As for me, ADB FTW!"

A couple of old friends suggested dinner there to try out their &amp;#39;must-try&amp;#39; all day brunches, and it was on the list of &amp;#39;trendy cafes in Singapore&amp;#39; that we&amp;#39;ve heard so much about. We weren&amp;#39;t allowed to make reservations, and despite arriving super early after rushing down from work, I couldn&amp;#39;t get seated to ensure 4 of my other friends had seats either, which was quite disappointing service. So there I was waiting alone outside while the restaurant slowly filled up, to the point where by the time all my friends arrived, we had to be seated at a table for 4, with an additional chair squeezed in. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was greatly talked about, so we went all out and got a banana toffee milkshake that came served in a colour and shape that was honestly that of doo-doo. It tasted cloying and overly artificial, and the drink slowly congealed into a paste towards the end of the meal - not tasty at all! <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered several different pancakes from their all day brunch menu that they were famous for, and the top choice was the Norwegian pancakes, that came with smoked salmon on scone like breads. This was average at best, with the accompanying sauce a bit too sour for my taste since it just made the eggs taste sour and the salmon taste bad. 2 stars at most for just having a good ambience in the restaurant."

I wouldn&amp;#39;t brave myself to Wild Honey until its 2nd outlet at Scott&amp;#39;s Square becomes operational; there - I have gotten my most important meal of the day fixed without having to wait, any time of the day.    <br&gt;<br&gt;Serving an array of breakfast dishes; distinguished by country that ranges from English, European, Belgian, Canadian,Tunisian to Japanese et cetra. While many raved about European - eggs Benedict; I heart English instead.<br&gt;<br&gt;The portion has been massive; it can feed 2 ladies with small appetite. Routinely, I would portion the plate unless I declared a NO dessert and could leave the place without any. What have been so enjoyable in the plate are those juicy pork meat cased in its crispy sausage skin. They are perfectly grilled without drying out and loosing their flavour. The toasted brioche is more provocative - rich in taste with a strong buttery note. Slightly fluffy yet crumbly in some parts. While the briny bacons compliment well with the bread, the scrambled eggs add moist and even-out the saltiness in the former. <br&gt;<br&gt;When waffles becomes unavailable, I will make good with a stack of pancake - Canadian. These thick fermented round flapjacks are doubled in size; 3s are somewhat excessive - sharing is more ideal. I am particularly fond of its texture - very light yet with some volume. They are relatively moist but not dampish. For a savory note, nibble on the bacons along with the cake. Otherwise, top it up either with maple syrup or homemade jam - the morning becomes more angelic."

The hostess stand had an iPad where we checked in digitally and received texts regarding the status of our table. The wait time was estimated at 45-60 minutes and we waited only 40 minutes. We walked around the mall and did some shopping to pass the time more quickly, which was a nice change of pace to lingering around the entrance. We received a call when our table was ready and were greeted by a friendly gentleman apologizing for how crazy it was, but we weren&amp;#39;t concerned at all because it was a holiday weekend. We were seated at the round counter and quickly greeted and put in drink orders - iced coffee. The menu had a lot of variety and offered meals from many regions around the world. I chose the Tunisian, which was chorizo and eggs in a tomato based sauce, with two hearty pieces of toast and a cucumber and tomato salad. It was incredibly tasty but not very filling since my Paleo lifestyle doesn&amp;#39;t allow me to consume grains. My hubby tried the special - duck confit potato hash topped with poached eggs and hollandaise. It was also very good. We topped off our meals with the berries, but passed on the yogurt. The service was good. The menu is a little limited if you&amp;#39;re paleo, but it&amp;#39;s not too hard to make it work. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and I was a fan of the music selection, which would fit into the &amp;#34;coffee house&amp;#34; genre. Overall, we were very pleased and will be back."

For starters, there&amp;#39;s a lot more space and a wider variety on its menu, and we can finally make reservations online instead of having to wake up at the crack of dawn on a weekend to queue for a table.<br&gt;<br&gt;Food : The best eggs Benedict I&amp;#39;ve had in Singapore. We shared the Tunisian, the Scandinavian, the European, the English, the Australian and I Love New York amongst us so that we could all get a taste of the different breakfast sets. The coffees were well made and a couple of us tried this Banoffee drink which was mad yummy! Being a ravenous lot, we also shared a bread basket while waiting for our breakfast sets to arrive. We particularly liked the croissant, evident in the fact we almost came to blows over the sole croissant in the basket. The homemade jams and honey too, were the perfect complement to the bread basket. If we hadn&amp;#39;t wanted to save some stomach space for our breakfast sets, we would have ordered one more! The most difficult decision you will face at Wild Honey is deciding which breakfast set to order, but whichever you decide, rest assured they are all equally tasty in their own indigenous way.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ambience : Love the mosaic tiles on the floor and the airy feel of the restaurant. The dark wood works well with the colorful furniture and drapes. Overall, the atmosphere is bustling yet comfortable, and is a great place to people watch on weekends. We like!<br&gt;<br&gt;Service : Can be a bit sketchy if one is sitting outside on the verandah. It is practically impossible to get service after the server takes our initial order, and the wait staff inside the restaurant are too busy to pay us any attention. If you can get their attention however, they are perfectly pleasant.<br&gt;<br&gt;Perfect if they can improve service standards. Prices are a bit steep for brunch but at least the large portions compensate somewhat. Reservations for weekend brunch at prime time absolutely necessary at least a week in advance."

During the 16th and 17th century, Chinese young men went to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia to find their fortune. They intermarried with non-Muslim women, birthing the Peranakan culture which has its own unique cuisine. One the of most unique ingredients they use in this food is the buah keluak or Pangium Edule seed. It is actually a poisonous seed that needs to be buried after harvesting to leach the toxins. However, the delicious, nutty, slightly bitter savory and soft flesh inside when cooked in a rich gravy is amazing. Chili Padi does a nice job picking, choosing good sized seeds that are not to old.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Ngoh Hiang or mined pork wrapped and deep fried in tofu skin also has a nice texture and is served with a slightly sweet sauce. <br&gt;<br&gt;Order the Bakwang Kepiting, a soup with meatballs. The broth is delicate and the meatballs, pretty good. I enjoyed eating it with their mild sambal belacan, chili sauce made with fermented shrimp and red chilies.

This is my all-time favourite salad bar. I probably go there twice a week. Fresh ingredients, friendly peeps and so much cheaper than Salad Stop!<br&gt;<br&gt;A Single, gets you a base of romaine and 5 toppings for $6.80. A Double (which supposedly feeds 2 peeps, but I eat it all by myself. Moo!) gets you a generous base of romaine and 8 toppings, all for $10. They also give unlimited herbs and condiments, like basil, oregeno, parsley, fried shallots, garlic and sesame seeds. I usually get the Roasted Sesame or Miso Sesame dressing. Premium items, like spinach, roast chicken or freshly grilled salmon (made in house), cost anything from $1 to $2.50 more each. Even then, my Doubles never cost more than $13. If I went to Salad Stop, I&amp;#39;d get half the amount for the same price. And for half the smiles too. (Alright, I&amp;#39;ll stop knocking Salad Stop!) They also serve wraps, soups, ice-cream waffles, cold pressed juices, coffee/tea and baked goods like macaroons, muffins, tarts. But I&amp;#39;m usually there to eat &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, so I just take in the smells. <br&gt;<br&gt;There is a seating area for about 15-20, but it looks a little crammed, so I usually take out. Probably not good for big groups. If you&amp;#39;re a student/staff from SMU, Kaplan, NAFA or Lasalle, you get one free additional topping, and if you are from RSM International, the Ascott Limited or Citadines, you get a special discount. They also have a loyalty card. 4 orders gets you a free topping, 8 gets you a free premium, and 13 gets you a free Single salad. <br&gt;<br&gt;I LOVE HAPPY TUMMY!"

It was lunchtime so I thought why not. <br&gt;<br&gt;The position of the restaurant is quite nice, having the seating in a corner means a spacious view including on the street (seeing the sky in a mall! who&amp;#39;d have thought), although the tables are very close together and you will bump into people. <br&gt;<br&gt;The burger patty definitely came from the freezer as did the sliced Kraft cheese on top. Salad was alright, although a few of the grapes were very soft. The sesame dressing was great, the chef has taste. The lemonade was enjoyable and did not have the cleaning fluid feel of the artificial stuff you find in food courts.  I just want to point out this is not a hipster salad bar with specially imported ingredients, just Cold Storage/Fairprice stuff thrown together at an attractive price, not a destination, but a good place to hang out if you already live here. Definitely a good option for a traditional breakfast, and I guess I should try the salads people are raving about. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, but a welcome addition to Wilkie for those of us who just want a simple healthy lunch without paying $20 at any of the mediocre &amp;#34;food concepts&amp;#34; nearby.

They will then give you a card that allows you to enter the pool area because this is located right in the middle Tower 2.<br&gt;<br&gt;The most wonderful thing about this is of course the view. You can choose to sit inside the adorably decorated restaurant or outside with a view of the harbour and ocean.

There were around 10+ types of cheeses (mostly French I believe) and countless chocolaty desserts. I wonder if cheese is a new addition because none of the previous reviews mentioned it.

I&amp;#39;d expect a much more extensive selection!

She did not make us two twenty-somethings seem out of place or overlooked, and that&amp;#39;s almost a yes in the industry. We had an average server who was there to refill our hot coffee and teas (included! which is a nice touch) when needed. Granted, we began our feast around 9PM, but our service wasn&amp;#39;t extraordinary and neither were the selections.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;d suggest more chocolate choices for non-nut eaters, although I do appreciate all of the allergens and gluten signs for those with restrictive eating plans. The cheeses were a letdown too. Only three hard cheeses, and a small selection of brie, blue, and soft? I&amp;#39;d expect so much more from MBS but also from an expensive buffet. I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend coming here if you&amp;#39;re really a chocolate maniac like we were, but also if you&amp;#39;ve been to places like Vegas or the States for buffets, I&amp;#39;d pass this place.

Don&amp;#39;t eat dinner! Come hungry so you can try all the different cakes, cookies, fondue, tarts, ice cream, hot chocolate and more that they have to offer. Trust me, if you eat anything before you come, you&amp;#39;re just not going to make it through. <br&gt;<br&gt;The dessert here is very good. I&amp;#39;m not going to say that it&amp;#39;s amazing or mind-blowing, because it&amp;#39;s not. But it&amp;#39;s very good. There is a passionfruit and chocolate cake there that I&amp;#39;m crazy about though. Not everything is pure chocolate. Everything does has something chocolate in it though, even if it&amp;#39;s just garnish. So there are many fruity things, light things, and very different things. This actually makes it nice because, realistically, how much chocolate could you really eat? There are so many choices of dessert, good luck trying everything. Don&amp;#39;t miss the fondue with the homemade marshmallows. <br&gt;<br&gt;Coffee and hot chocolate is included and you can pay for cocktails. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unfortunately, there are no tables in this place that has a view off the front of the hotel. There is outdoor seating, but it faces the back, and so not over the city, Marina Bay and the pool. But, being able to get up to the pool is pretty great. And you should definitely walk around up there before or after your sugar overdose. Don&amp;#39;t tell the staff at the restaurant that though, because they will tell you that you have to straight back down, and that walking around is not allowed -- just do it, and no one will bother you."

Perfect for any day of the time. <br&gt;<br&gt;The chocolate and cheese buffet are also superb. Great variety and selection. I cannot find anything wrong with the spread.<br&gt;<br&gt;But I would like to point out the WORST SERVICE ever for a great establishment. The waitresses assigned to my section were not attentive, not service oriented and rude.<br&gt;They are always not available to be called for beverage orders. It&amp;#39;s amazing difficult to call them to your table. When they do come to your table, they don&amp;#39;t seems to be interested in their services. They don&amp;#39;t ask what kind or coffee/tea you wanted. Hey, at least ask if u want a latte or black or etc. In addition, they don&amp;#39;t automatically clear your plates and cups. If they don&amp;#39;t clear those used utensils, who will?!? What a f-Ing morons. If these waitresses don&amp;#39;t like what they do, then quit! I don&amp;#39;t have to get serviced by low class waitresses. <br&gt;<br&gt;Definitely spoiled my night. <br&gt;<br&gt;However, I have to single out our hostess, she is very polite and professional. She greeted us well and brought us to our table promptly. That&amp;#39;s the service I actually expected. <br&gt;<br&gt;Management should fire most of the waitresses that work tonight, Nov 7, 2015.

The bread that came with the omelet was the downside of the meal - it was dry and did not serve a purpose at all. In fact, it absorbed a large portion of the moisture from the omelet. <br&gt;<br&gt;I also got to try their French bean in Szechuan sauce - this is like your regular si ji dou - except cooked with lots of flavor.

I am not sure if he is the owner or just an employee, but it does not matter. Everyone should have a passion for what they do. Because of him and his zeal for the food, I actually bought more than I initially wanted.<br&gt;<br&gt;I went in wanting to buy the gula melaka kaya jam. I love kaya and gula melaka, combine them together and it seemed like heaven. It does taste very nice too, a softer sweetness from the gula melaka. <br&gt;<br&gt;The cakes caught my attention and I decided to have a slice of cake with coffee. Again, the guy was so into his stuff that he paired my drink with the cake. Latte with hokkaido roll (green tea with red bean flavor). The cake was light and not very sweet but it was enough to complement the smoothness of the latte which was not too acidic. I usually doctored my coffee liberally with milk and sugar. He told me to try it without any sugar, and it was fine. <br&gt;<br&gt;I also bought a tiramisu to go. That was very rich and creamy. <br&gt;<br&gt;The place is small with just a couple of small tables. Definitely not a place for big groups of people to chill, but it is cozy enough for 1 or 2 persons for a cuppa and slice of cake. <br&gt;<br&gt;I would love to try the sandwiches and sourdough bread and the signature cake - Chocolate Trovana which needs advance order. <br&gt;<br&gt;If the location is more convenient to me, I think I will be a regular at Chef Icon. <br&gt;<br&gt;Yelp Feb 2014 Challenge: 26/28"

Unfortunately, there isn&amp;#39;t a big capacity for sit ins. 8 people would already be pushing it. I had coffee, the Hokkaido roll (chocolate &amp;amp; strawberry), the Yakiniku Sandwich in my visits there. Everything did not disappoint. The sandwich was fantastic! It was tasty, healthy with fresh greens and yummy yakiniku mushrooms all stuffed into a sesame bread. As for the Hokkaido roll, the sponge cake was moist yet light and fluffy but dense. How did he do it? The strawberry is good with the coffee while the chocolate (Belgian, no less!) was slightly sweeter and heavier on the palate. My colleague bought the Banana chocolate cake and it was heavenly! Moist yet rich with chocolate flavour, it blended really well with the banana as well. The owner, whom I spoke to, mentioned the food has no preservatives which means it also doesn&amp;#39;t sell any products with animal based ingredients. Have been there twice. Would definitely drop by when I&amp;#39;m in the neighbourhood. Love it!"

I got the above mentioned breakfast set, which was set A. There was a set B, C, and D, which had different kinds of kaya toast. I remember set D was a kaya peanut butter toast which also sounded amazing. <br&gt;<br&gt;The kaya butter toast was pretty delicious the bread is very toasted and crispy. At one point, the nice old man sat down with me and showed me how to properly eat kaya toast. He asked to put soy sauce and some black pepper into my runny eggs.

Now about the actual food<br&gt;<br&gt;Kaya Toast - kaya jam is made from eggs, coconut, and pandan. While eating the kaya toast, the flavor is primarily sweet with a hint of coconut richness and a whiff of floral pandan, but sweetness is really the primary impression here. Also, due to the generous spread of butter/margarine, kaya toast feels a lot heavier than you might expect. I thought that the soft and runny soft boiled eggs would be too much for me but I think the quality of the eggs are better here or they&amp;#39;re just perfectly cooked.

My food came out piecemeal - coffee, then 10 minutes later eggs, and another 15 later the toast but luckily I had the whole morning to hang around so enjoyed people watching in the interim.  This was clearly a super popular spot, and you can see why. If you like a breakfast on the sweeter side, you&amp;#39;ll likely enjoy this runny egg/jam and french toast like concoction with sweet Singapore coffee. Be prepared for the sugar rush that follows and don&amp;#39;t forget to bring your own wet wipes/napkins (probably an obvious for most of you used to Singapore but I was constantly walking around with sticky hands!)"

I guess this is a very traditional breakfast for Singaporeans, so I had to try it since breakfast is my absolute favorite meal of the day. I could seriously eat it for every meal. I loved the flavor of the kaya and it meshed really well with the toasted, warm bread. The butter was something I had a hard time with. I felt like when I got to the middle of the toast, I was just eating an entire tablespoon of butter along with the toast/kaya. I could seriously feel my arteries clogging by the second. However, when I asked a Singaporean if it was supposed to be like that, she said yes, and the butter is the best part! Perhaps I&amp;#39;m not cultured enough to understand all that butter, and next time, I&amp;#39;m just going to get kaya toast, no butter! I mean, the butter was good, I just couldn&amp;#39;t stand eating it, knowing that it was just a chunk of butter. On the other hand, the milk tea here had good flavor, although it was a little too sweet for my liking. However, it was a great drink to drink with my food! <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, my first experience with kaya was really good, and I even went to the store later on to purchase a jar of it to bring home.

This one was average at best; I&amp;#39;ve had better ones elsewhere.

Old Habit brings back even more nostalgia with their old outdoor seating area. Made up of vintage clam shell chairs, you would have expected a couple of old uncles in singlets to be asleep on the chairs, if not for the bright lights of the cafe.<br&gt;<br&gt;Opening the door, we were expecting to be hit by a wave of muskiness from the old items on display but was pleasantly surprised when the place smelt pretty.... Good! <br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for a fun antique items to buy than this is the place for you! <br&gt;Old telephones, photos, textbooks, comics, you name it, they have it. It&amp;#39;s like being a 5 year old again. With their extensive collection of view finders / view masters, it was hours of  fun going through everything they had to offer and the best part? Almost everything&amp;#39;s for sale!<br&gt;<br&gt;Now to the food. A simple menu made up of around 5-6 items per category (Appetizers, mains etc), &amp;#34;Old Habit&amp;#34; chooses to keep it simple and manageable, ensuring that by not over stretching themselves with an overly extensive menu, they will not sacrifice the quality of the food being served.<br&gt;<br&gt;Drinks: <br&gt;Lemon Lime Float &amp;amp; CoCo Melaka <br&gt;<br&gt;What better way to add to the nostalgia of the cafe than with a drink that reminds us of the past. Well thought through and re-created, the Lemon Lime Float tastes exactly like Solero, a lime and vanilla ice cream that I&amp;#39;m sure many of us LOVED while we were younger. <br&gt;A perfect drink for a really really hot day! <br&gt;The CoCo Melaka Soda was a nice twist. Coconut juice, with a hint of Gula Melaka topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. <br&gt;The Gula Melaka adds a nice richness n sweetness to an otherwise ordinary drink and even helps in bringing out the sweetness and fragrance of the coconut juice. <br&gt;<br&gt;Spaghetti Carbonara. <br&gt;Will I ever learn my lesson? Ordering Carbonaras even though I see the words &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34;. I&amp;#39;m proud to finally say that, this carbonara is pretty darn good! <br&gt;<br&gt;Unlike most Carbonaras, we could actually taste the eggs in the sauce. <br&gt;The sauce was rich, eggy and so delicious! Pasta was al Dante and that sprinkle of chilli powder gave it an extra kick. Only thing is lacked was a good sprinkle of parmesan to give is that sharpness but overall, definitely one the nicest we&amp;#39;ve had under $15.00.<br&gt;<br&gt;Jessy&amp;#39;s Spicy Casserole<br&gt;Now this was an interesting twist! Unlike the normal Shepard&amp;#39;s Pie, this was done with a chicken chunks marinated in a Nonya sauce. <br&gt;The initial scoop felt a little disappointing, with the lack of gravy and meat, but as we slowly dug in, revealing the juicy pieces of chicken, we soon realised that a gravy wasn&amp;#39;t really needed! <br&gt;<br&gt;The nonya sauce or marinade used was so tasty! And the mashed used had a hint of curry powder which added to the fragrance of the dish, elevating the potatoes to a whole different level of yumness.<br&gt;<br&gt;This was a very well constructed dish that turned an otherwise ordinary shepherd&amp;#39;s pie into something a little more local. <br&gt;<br&gt;Coconut kueh with Vanilla Ice cream. <br&gt;What a way to end our meal with this delicious dessert! With crunchy coconut flakes prominent in the kueh, this felt like an Asian take on a bread and butter pudding. The fragrant smell of toasted coconut flakes mixed with the sweetness from the ice cream and the slight saltiness from kueh makes this an absolute delight to have. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, this place is fantastic, with the owners taking the time to slowly show you some of the cool toys they have available. They&amp;#39;re friendly and very welcoming and you can tell that they have the dedication and passion to keep this place going, ensuring that whether you&amp;#39;re 6 or 60, you&amp;#39;ll feel like a kid again once you step through the doors of Old Habits."

Cheesecakes are pretty decent too. <br&gt;<br&gt;Great place to grab a take-out lunch. A bit too squeezy for sit-in lunch. We kept bumping into other tables."

We tried the chirashi bowl, ramen aglio olio with foie gras and smoked duck, as well as the miso cod.<br&gt;<br&gt;The miso cod was really good, portion size is pretty small but unsurprising given how miso cods are always served in really tiny portions in restaurants.

Otherwise it&amp;#39;ll only make you hungrier.<br&gt;<br&gt;The ramen was somewhat of a disappointment. The smoked duck was too dry, I presume they sautéed it as well with the ramen but that process probably drained out some of the juices. There were 2 tiny tiny pieces of foie gras, which given the price of the dish seems slightly unreasonable. I mean it&amp;#39;s literally fried instant ramen, so that&amp;#39;s probably not where the cost went. That leaves the 3-4 pieces of smoked duck and 2 pieces of foie gras the size of my thumb. Which makes it the most expensive piece of foie gras I ever ate. <br&gt;<br&gt;The sushi looks fresh though, and their uni dishes look pretty good though I didnt try it.

I don&amp;#39;t know how they make it but it is this heavenly mix of salmon roe, spring egg, seaweed, spring onion, and some sort of jelly. Also recommend their udon linguine with clam and vegi, very light yet balanced. Besides these two, we ordered seafood salad, fried truffle prawn as well as fried chicken, all pretty good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Cocktails are delicious but the prices are on the higher end. I got two earl grey martinis and they are about $19 each.<br&gt;<br&gt;The light was soft but not too dark.

The dude said  it tasted like fish jerky while I put it down to FISH BAK KWA. Complete with wide eyes and lick of the lips. The (I think) slightly fermented octopus and cucumber was a refreshing version of kimchi and was very small even for a bar bite. We rounded things off with chicken karaage as a tummy filler. Quite a poor cousin of 5 Izakaya&amp;#39;s version but then again, most places do crappy soggy fried chicken these days.<br&gt;<br&gt;For drinks, I tried the yuzu prosecco, which was not as sweet as I expected (in a good way). The drink as a whole was light, fresh and balanced and a perfect starter to a meal. The dude had a pint of Asahi and there were no complaints there. Overall the food &amp;amp; drink did the job."

I&amp;#39;m so tired of going to restaurants when the server has no idea what&amp;#39;s going on, takes 10 minutes to bring in an associate to explain, and this associate has no idea that I can spot bull all the way to KL. There was one Australian (?) server who was pretty knowledgeable though he left mid-way through our meal. The sashimi platter was good but definitely not as fresh as other places I&amp;#39;ve tried. I would say the sashimi at TFS is aligned with Sakae Sushi but with prices aligned with Sushi Tei. Out of the 7 tapas we tried, I only really enjoyed the truffle fried ebi. But I enjoy everything with truffle oil so no crowd pleaser here. <br&gt;<br&gt;Am I being too mean here? Wweeelll...I def. won&amp;#39;t come back here again.

(Brunch dishes - they&amp;#39;re just eggs y&amp;#39;all!) I suppose when youngsters (and older, aka me) started turning up at cafes in droves with their laptops and staying for hours.<br&gt;<br&gt;At least with Regroup, I didn&amp;#39;t feel too bad parting with $17 for my squid ink linguine (4 stars). For starters, it had soft shell crab in it. While the crab wasn&amp;#39;t as delicately crispy as others I&amp;#39;ve had, the garlicky, spicy sauce was right up my alley. Typically, I feel like I order squid ink pasta more for its unique colour (I&amp;#39;m a sucker for green tea and pistachio flavoured items because of their gorgeous colours. Heck, I swear it was the wildly unnatural, beautiful lilac skins of yam baos [taro buns] that conned me into consuming far more of them than is probably advisable). But this time, the linguine itself seemed to be that much more flavourful. Warning: Don&amp;#39;t eat this before an important presentation or risk looking like a toothless pirate.<br&gt;<br&gt;Tried some of my friend&amp;#39;s truffle mushroom soup (4 stars) - it didn&amp;#39;t taste creamy and wasn&amp;#39;t salty. She found it a bit bland though. Also had some of her goldrush waffle (4 stars). The waffle was somewhere nicely between being soft and crispy, the dark chocolate ice cream was solid, and the honeycomb crumbs were a nice touch. The salted egg sauce was good, but it&amp;#39;s not my thing to begin with. I had a single scoop of ice cream and the girl at the counter very nicely agreed to do 2 generous half scoops for me, making it $4 well-spent. Their pistachio (4 stars) is definitely one of the better ones I&amp;#39;ve had. The stout butterbeer (3.5 stars) had a good flavour but melted too quickly.<br&gt;<br&gt;Besides the food, I love the decor of the place (5 stars). It&amp;#39;s spacious, brightly lit, and minimalist. They also have 3 fans going in addition to the air-conditioning - I&amp;#39;m guessing because the large windows make it fairly warm in the day. It was pretty empty on a weekday afternoon, and I got some studying done. Note that there&amp;#39;s no wifi available. I see their pistachio latte, smoked salmon salad, and a good book making a perfect afternoon in my near future."

Came here for lunch on a saturday ard 12nn and all the indoor seats were taken so we had to settle with sitting outside along the corridor.<br&gt;<br&gt;While Fine Palate is well-known for it&amp;#39;s catering service, dinning at the restaurant is equally enjoyable though I have to say that the price is slightly steep. My friend and I ordered the Eggs Benedict and Steak &amp;amp; Eggs to share. I really love the steak. It&amp;#39;s moist and tender though we had to send it back to get the steak cooked again cos while we asked for medium rare, the steak came out a little too rare for us.<br&gt;<br&gt;The meal started with a serving of some fresh bread (that tasted really well) with a purple dragonfruit dip. The colour of the dip was amazing with a rich purple that actually made us really curious how the dip would taste like (instead of a turn off as with some scary coloured food). It has the fragrance of the dragonfruit and richness of olive oil and a slightly salted taste. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service staff were also extremely helpful and personable. The overall experience would had been fantastic except it got terribly upsetting cos of the rain. While we were enjoying ourselves catching up over a great meal, the sky starting pouring and the rain splattered all over our table. There was no where we could shift to cos the indoor seating were all taken and the restaurant had no other form of shelter or sorts to shelter us and the food. I had to take out my own foldable umbrella to try to keep my friend and i, together with our food, safe from the pouring rain.<br&gt;<br&gt;I hope Fine Palate will seriously look into the conditions of their outdoor dinning so that patrons&amp;#39; experience will not be at risk due to adverse weather conditions.<br&gt;<br&gt;Note: Fine Palate is now open for dinner too!"

They sell a pretty decent variety of buns and cakes and I had a taste of their cranberry cheese bun, which I heard was their specialty. It was still warm when I bought it and was an absolute delight. The bread was soft and light, yet not too airy. My only comment is that there could have been more cream cheese as I was eating plain bread in some of my bites.<br&gt;<br&gt;Their chocolate buns are brilliant and their tiramisu is not too bad. While the tiramisu is not exactly the traditional ones you get in italy or in decent italian restaurants, it is light and has a nice coffee flavour. Their buns and cakes are priced pretty average. I can&amp;#39;t remember how much the cakes cost but the cream cheese cranberry bun cost $1.50 which is pretty standard these days."

Kaya Toast (~$1.50): I&amp;#39;ve tried this a few times and I&amp;#39;m not hooked, but I know it is extremely popular.  The dish is made by liberally spreading butter and kaya (eggs, sugar, coconut milk and pandan) on 2 thin slices of white toast and making a sandwich<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Peanut Butter Thick Toast ($1.70): A few bites of this and you may feel that you have enough sustenence to run a marathon.  The thick cut toast is buttered and toasted slightly crispy and then slathered with chunky, not too sweet peanut butter.  Before handing it over, they cut the piece of toast into 9 small squares and provide a toothpick to eat it without getting your hands dirty.  It is extremely potent, and you may want to bring a buddy for sharing<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Kopi (~$1.50): Classic kopi is the local coffee and reminds me a bit of Vietnamese coffee.  It is made with thick, dark coffee and condensed milk.  If you prefer your coffee unsweeted with evaporated milk, make sure you order &amp;#34;kopi &amp;#39;c&amp;#39; kosong&amp;#34;.  Standard kopi is served sweetened<br&gt;<br&gt;PARTING THOUGHT: My colleagues told me that you can actually get the already extravagant peanut butter thick toast kicked up a notch with a liberal drizzle of condensed milk, so that is on my list next!"

I guess this is one of those things that irritates the hell out of me. <br&gt;<br&gt;Macaron - a French meringue based confection filled with butter cream, ganache or jam sandwiched between two cookies, characterized by smooth domed top, ruffled edge and a flat base. <br&gt;<br&gt;Macaroon - a type of small circular cake originated from Italy which usually has coconut as one of the ingredients; crispy on the outside and chewy in the inside. <br&gt;<br&gt;Even when one fellow yelper here who was so kind to point out it was really not macaroons but macarons, some yelpers still continued to label macarons as macaroons. Learn it right before one ends up becoming a laughing stock somewhere. And I am serious! <br&gt;<br&gt;Enough of my ranting (can you really blame me?), this TWG location is located on the 2nd floor, near Harry Winston and the entrance/exit which leads to the taxi stand. I supposed they closed the other TWG on the first floor which I like very much. <br&gt;<br&gt;Came here last month with my friend and we had a good brunch (Croque Monsieur) with two pots of Golden Rose.

Specifically, I ordered about 25 different varieties of loose tea, which they sell in 50g batches.<br&gt;<br&gt;I admit I&amp;#39;m not a connoisseur, but I found their teas to be delicious. Not just the higher priced ones either. In fact, their house brand &amp;#39;1837 White Tea&amp;#39; is actually my favorite and is on the low-end of the price scale. I&amp;#39;ve quickly grown addicted to both the amazing smell and taste every day. I would also add that they included several free samples of other teas (in decent amounts as well, enough for several pots at least) in my order that they thought I would like based upon my purchase. Especially for a beginner like me, this is particularly useful as they have a bewildering array (hundreds) of varieties.<br&gt;<br&gt;I will definitely continue to be a customer going forward, and I would recommend their product to anyone."

I loved the huge tea selection, and the waiter made some nice suggestions after I asked for something flowery and light. I got the 1 tea + dessert combination (~20SGD) to share with my friend since we had just completed a delicious dinner earlier.<br&gt;<br&gt;If I were back in Singapore, I could see this as a great hang-out spot to catch up with friends and drink some fancy tea + have cake at any hour of the day.

It&amp;#39;s green tea with a twist : the tea is infused with chunks of berries (I detect strawberries and raspberries) and comes with the prettiest blue / silver packaging... I&amp;#39;m such a sucker for pretty packaging. It&amp;#39;s quite light and fragrant, and perfect for something lighter on caffeine in the evening.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The Emperor Sencha is also quite good, although it&amp;#39;s stronger than Silver Moon.<br&gt;<br&gt;Earl Grey Buddha is another one I enjoy - it has a twist of Bergamot instead of the usual Lavender, etc.<br&gt;<br&gt;Black tea: <br&gt;<br&gt;Strangely enough I&amp;#39;ve just realised I don&amp;#39;t get much black tea from TWG (I prefer my single-blend straight from Ceylonese estates) , but you can&amp;#39;t go wrong with their English Breakfast and Five O&amp;#39;Clock Tea . <br&gt;<br&gt;It only gets 4 stars because the teas are expensive! The loose-leaf sometimes cost me $20. It&amp;#39;s good though, I kind of want to buy every single tea in this shop.  I also buy their cotton bags when I&amp;#39;m lazy to brew my tea and just want to dump it in the cotton bags - they&amp;#39;re expensive though, about $5 + for 10 bags, so I use them sparingly. <br&gt;<br&gt;P/S: Try the rose macaroons too.

I have picked one up at Jason&amp;#39;s grocery and also at The American Club. Both were good, but the lemon one today from this lovely tea spot was fabulous! I did not eat anything else there. I only walked in and picked up a lemon macaroon for the reasonable price of $2 SGD to go. It was pure perfection! I will be back to try other flavours, but that lemon one will be hard to beat!"

Having been supporting TWG since its first outlet at Republic Plaza, I am glad to say that the quality of their pastries have remained consistent even after so many years. I am not over-exaggerating when I said that I have tried nearly all their cakes and is recognised as the &amp;#34;girl who always buy cakes&amp;#34;.  However, I am still trying out new stuff because the selection is always ever-changing.<br&gt; <br&gt;The patisseries at TWG there rarely disappoint and I would dare say that it is the only place in Singapore that matches those in Paris or Japan. ( I was surprised when I walked past one branch in Jiyugaoka). Why? Simply because the pastries have textuality, technicality, creativity and of course flavours.<br&gt; <br&gt;Most of the pastries at TWG are mousse cakes besides tarts. What impresses me is that the texture of the mousse is always just right while the sponge remains moist (perhaps some have been soaked in liquids). Fruit compotes of different berries ( raspberry/blueberry/cassis) are usually very sour which curbs the creaminess from other components. The tart shell has remained consistently crispy so far. While I can&amp;#39;t say that every single piece I&amp;#39;ve tried is 100% perfect, I appreciate the chef&amp;#39;s efforts to keep on inventing, playing with the flavours, textures and presentation. It is hard to spot a classic pastry here (perhaps the millefeuille or the signature chocolate fondant) but it is still possible to find new flavours in their classic pastries.<br&gt; <br&gt;I doubt what I have commented will be readily available since the selection keeps changing. Amazed by the rapid expansion of this Singapore tea brand in Singapore and overseas in such a short period of time, it will be interesting to see what new exciting flavours TWG will offer in future."

Like bourbon or whiskey, too much leaves a bad aftertaste in your mouth and same goes for this tea. No more than one cup for this particular tea. Overall TWG is your typical English inspired high tea place with gold trimmings to mimic upper class society dining similar to the era of the Titanic.

Well, at least the portion of it sensible enough not to splurge on high tea, I suppose. The tea-related desserts were good! But mains and ice cream flavours were a little hit and miss.<br&gt;<br&gt;Mains: <br&gt;We had scrambled egg with saffron, and foie gras terrine which came with fresh brioche toast. For the egg, you get to choose between three flavours: matcha, saffron, and truffle oil. Matcha+egg sounded a little Dr Seuss so we skipped over that. But I think picking saffron was a mistake, since the saffron flavour didn&amp;#39;t come out at all. I was initially skeptical about the foie gras but it turned out to be a winner. The toast was crispy, and soft but not soggy, and the foie gras spread perfectly over it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Tea:<br&gt;The selection of tea here really is overwhelming. We zoomed in to the &amp;#34;exclusive blends&amp;#34; section of the menu and ended up with something called Snow Mountain Tea, which is white tea. It was light, clear, and refreshing, and went really well with the dessert.<br&gt;<br&gt;Dessert:<br&gt;Madeleines with clotted cream and some TWG Tea jelly, and three macarons. I adore the macarons here. Flavours are rich enough and ingredients are fairly decent quality, something I can&amp;#39;t say for many other macarons made in SG. The madeleines were also a delight -- fluffy and warm and perfect with the cream and the jelly. I love the jelly so much I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind eating it every day. We also had two scoops of ice cream. One was dark pink and tasted of berries, I can&amp;#39;t remember its name but it might have been the Timeless. Not memorable, not worth getting. The other was the Napoleon which had macadamias. This was good."

The iced coffee was strong, but I&amp;#39;m not sure what kind of milk they put in it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Advice - bring a local and have them order for you.

Ordered the Marinara Pasta ($8.20) for lunch and it was below average. Pasta was not al dente and too hot, methinks it was cooked earlier and microwaved to order. The marinara sauce was pretty plain, it is supposed to have a medium strength flavour, and was disappointing.<br&gt;<br&gt;No serviettes or tissues on the table, place was fairly empty when I arrived at 12:30pm whereas other restaurants were full, avoid this like organised religion."
