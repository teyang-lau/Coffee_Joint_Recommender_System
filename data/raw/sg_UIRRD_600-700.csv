I am lucky to get a reservation for 5 persons during its weekend high tea buffet which usually costs $42++ per person. It is even cheaper than the usual credit card 1-for-1 promotions.<br&gt;<br&gt;Although reservation has been made long before, we are met with a long of people waiting before the buffet start. The local high tea buffet comes with an amazing line-up of more than 50 treats.<br&gt;<br&gt;There is wide variety of cooked food such as Satay, Nasi Lemak, Chicken Rice. There is also a variety of malay kueh. For dessert lovers, there is sliced cakes and pastries. Using your creative ideas to make your favourite Ice Kacang. The dessert of the day turns out to be Tau Suan (split green bean soup). There is also ice cream station with 5 different flavours available. One of the favourite station is the DIY salad station which has a variety of items and even items such as chai seeds. Great for those who are eating clean. There is live stations for laksa and crepe. You get to choose the items such as vegetables and noodles for the laksa and the chef will cook for you.  For the crepe station, one can get to choose the filling such as banana, chocolate and kaya. There is topping such as caramel chocolate bits, desiccated coconut, marshmallow and clotted cream. For those who prefer traditional English style of high tea, there is scones, served with clotted cream and jam. The scone is not bad except that it is a bit dry. <br&gt;<br&gt;There is a wide variety for the high tea buffet which comes with free flow of coffee and tea.

Mille crepe cake 3/5: we wanted to get Lady M but the queue was long, so we settled for this crepe cake. However, we were really disappointed as the layers were thick and the overall cake rather dry. There was also strawberry compote and azuki red beans that were just too sweet when combined with the rest of the cake. <br&gt;2. Green tea tiramisu 5/5: comes with tea to combat the subtle sweetness. <br&gt;3. Ice cream parfait 4/5: use that long spoon to get to the bottom pudding layer! The matcha soft serve itself is really rich and impressive, so combined with mochi, azuki, and all that other flair, this parfait still satisfies your sweet tooth without overshadowing the dominant matcha flavor."

I&amp;#39;ve been itching to try Singapore&amp;#39;s infamous Kaya Toast and luckily, Toast Box was only a few minutes away from my hotel. Not to mention, it was opened bright and early, which was perfect for the jet lagged me. <br&gt;<br&gt;Toast Box is situated at the basement of The Centrepoint and one of the earliest places opened for business in the building. When I got to Toast Box with my boyfriend, there were already a few customers enjoying their breakfast and one person ahead of us. When it was our turn, we told the lady what we wanted but she asked us questions in Mandarin. Unfortunately, our Mandarin is pretty crappy but we used context clues. LOL. My boyfriend saw noodles on the menu so he tried to order that but it wasn&amp;#39;t available. Not sure if it&amp;#39;s not a breakfast thing or just no longer on the menu. So he got the cheese toast (came with ham and egg on top) while I got the Kaya toast. The lady asked us what drinks we would like with our meals and what type of eggs we wanted with the Kaya Toast. We went with honey tea, milk tea, and soft boiled eggs (came with 2 eggs). <br&gt;<br&gt;The seating area is small but there&amp;#39;s more seats and tables outside of the enclosed space! The drinks, Kaya toast, and eggs were ready under 5 minutes. But the cheese w/ ham &amp;amp; egg toast took awhile. Understandable as there was only one lady managing the cash register and one man cooking. <br&gt;<br&gt;My kaya toast was delicious! Crusty on the outside and amazingly sweet and warm inside. The kaya (coconut jam) flavor was very subtle and blended perfectly with the slice of butter that was slightly melting from the warm toast. What surprised me even more were the soft boiled eggs. Omg. How can something so simple taste so addictingly good?! The cheese toast was just alright. Really liked the milk tea too. Comparable to Hong Kong&amp;#39;s cha chan tang&amp;#39;s. <br&gt;<br&gt;I saw jars of Hainanese kaya being sold by Toast Box for around $5-$6. I was really tempted to buy it but then I found kaya being sold at Cold Storage. It was a supermarket on the same floor as Toast Box. It wasn&amp;#39;t the Toast Box brand but it was only $3 so I went with that instead lol."

I guess with the flurry of small cafes, bakeries, patisseries sprouting up in recent months (or is it years already?), it is hard to keep track. After a while, they really do seem to serve the same old stuff, taste about the same, cost also about the same, that most are pretty forgettable. <br&gt;<br&gt;I may like a pretty thing but what will leave an indelible impression will be the taste. Taste over appearance for me. <br&gt;<br&gt;The first impression of Carpenter and Cook is the darkness and seemingly messiness. It is not really messy, but it has a lot of things (antique or old stuff) crammed into the shop. And many wooden furniture inside also makes the place look darker than it actually is. <br&gt;<br&gt;I do quite like the vibe. Almost indie to me. Everything sort of work together even though everything is so mis-matched. That adds to the charm. You just share a big table if there are no smaller tables available. Quite nice actually. Everyone talks in a normal/soft tone so it is just a low hum of conversation, nothing jarring to the ears. And so you won&amp;#39;t be an unwilling eavesdropper at all, even if you are sharing a table with strangers. <br&gt;<br&gt;After checking reviews on what was the recommended food (i.e. passionfruit meringue tart and lemon cream tart - isn&amp;#39;t that wonderful of having a smartphone and internet and google and yelp and blogs?), I went to place my order. <br&gt;<br&gt;While there, I was very taken with the lemon meringue cake and the banoffee tart. They looked very tempting. I decided to just try the lemon meringue cake. It is quite rare to find a meringue cake and even rarer to find one which does it well. <br&gt;<br&gt;I love the lemon meringue cake which has 2 layers of sponge cake with a thin layer of  lemon curd and topped with meringue all around. The cake was moist and you could really taste the freshness of it. No day-old cake at all. The tartness of the lemon made a perfect foil against the slight sweetness of the cake and the sweeter meringue which was also very nicely done.  I liked that the meringue was not the typical hard type when served on its own but was a bit foamy soft and yet could stand on its own. You could just taste the egg white and sugar whipped until stiff and then browned a little in the heat. <br&gt;<br&gt;The sea salt chocolate caramel tart was nice but nothing memorable. For a chocolate lover, it is saying a lot when I actually prefer the tart instead of the sweet.<br&gt;<br&gt;P.S. I like the placement of lemons scattered all over the place. It does create a pop of color and cheer in the brownness of the place."

Gets rather gelat after a while. <br&gt;<br&gt;Still, nothing like enjoying a nice meal with their quaint ambience, and sipping tea and coffee. Will come back next time for their tarts!"

It&amp;#39;ll be a place where friends will share secrets over a pot of tea, where lovers reunite, where lost treasures are found. But dreams will remain as dreams unless you have the courage to pursue it. So they did. And Carpenter and Cook was born. <br&gt;<br&gt;The shop is exactly out of a fairy tale. The nostalgia and charm of a time lost and then rediscovered. The interior is warmy and cosy, peppered with an eclectic mix of handpicked and restored furniture. There is just this air of positivity and hope. I guess it must have come from Phoebe, Shenn and Eunice, who obviously have put in their heart and soul into the place. <br&gt;<br&gt;There is something romantic about old furniture. Who did it belong to? What was the owner like? Why did they buy it? Who was it for? Each piece comes with a history that we may never know about; each a mystery.<br&gt;<br&gt;I pondered these over the freshly baked tarts (S$6.20) and a cup of mocha. The bakes are as dreamy as everything else. These are made by the Cordon Bleu trained hands of Shenn and each bite was as delicious as you can imagine. For me, my search for the best tart ends here. <br&gt;<br&gt;The crisp and buttery tart base is everything one would look for. It doesn&amp;#39;t fall to pieces when you cut or bite into it. Neither is it too soft that it fails to hold the filling. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel tart was a bitter sweet delight. I like that it isn&amp;#39;t too cloyingly sweet. A hint of sea salt gives way to a smokey caramel and then you hit the bitter notes of the chocolate in the aftertaste. There is a clear separation of the chocolate and the tart but it melts from the warmth of your lips and becomes a rich elixir that goes down easily. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Lemon Cream tart was a custard and eggy delight. It&amp;#39;s a little sharp but that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s character. I guess a person&amp;#39;s taste preference is also an indication of what they are like. Obviously i&amp;#39;m not the sweet and docile girl. I declare this to be the best tart in Singapore. It can&amp;#39;t get better than this."

As we waited in line for a seat, the couple next to us used a vintage display cabinet as a tabletop for filling in a form to have their pre-wedding shoot held here.<br&gt;<br&gt;As with all wildly popular eateries, there&amp;#39;s always a presumption that service will be brusque and impersonal. I&amp;#39;m happy to report that the servers we encountered at Carpenter &amp;amp; Cook were welcoming and chirpy. Furnished with rustic pieces acquired by one of its three co-owners from all over the world, the cafe exuded a homely and laid-back vibe in spite of the teatime crowd. Communal seating is practised here, which is fine by me since I&amp;#39;ve recently been trained not to attack openly affectionate couples.<br&gt;<br&gt;Lavender Bundt Cake, $4.00 - Whilst surveying the pastries on display, we were a little taken aback by how steep the prices were. It took just four bites to finish this palm-sized bundt cake (we&amp;#39;re talking preschooler hands here), which tasted quite uninspiring. It was my first encounter with lavender in cake form, though apart from some notes of cinnamon I frankly couldn&amp;#39;t detect anything else in the cake. I also felt the honey glaze was superfluous since it added neither depth of flavor nor moisture to the cake, which was a little too dry.<br&gt;<br&gt;Passionfruit Meringue Tart, $6.50 - Highly raved about in almost every review of Carpenter &amp;amp; Cook I&amp;#39;ve read, this tart had a crisp, buttery shell that broke off easily when you cut into it with a fork. The beautifully seared meringue peaks had a texture akin to toasted marshmallow innards... that&amp;#39;s actually meant to be much more delicious than it reads. Found the passionfruit curd way too sweet, but supporters swear by it so if too much sugar&amp;#39;s your thing, go right ahead and order this.<br&gt;<br&gt;Smashing Savoury Brioche Bun (Veg.), $6.50 - A sprinkle of sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, olives and a couple sprigs of parsley on a fluffy brioche bun. I have to say the bun was moist, soft and wonderfully herby, but for six friggin&amp;#39; fifty? I wouldn&amp;#39;t have ordered this if I were allowed to have things my own tyrannical way.<br&gt;<br&gt;Triple chocolate chip muffin, $3.50 - This was a flat out disaster. The muffin was so dry that every poke of the fork triggered an avalanche of crumbs. Also, the chocolate used was sickeningly sweet and of exceedingly poor quality - I say this as someone who has no qualms about eating Van Houten chocolates by the boxful.<br&gt;<br&gt;Flat White, $5.00 - Like any Singaporean cafe worth their salt, Carpenter &amp;amp; Cook utilises the Speakeasy blend from Liberty Coffee. Sadly, premium beans alone do not a good cup of coffee make. My flat white was served lukewarm, left a slightly acrid aftertaste, and came with zero art boohoohoo. Maybe it was because the cafe was crowded when we visited, but they could definitely pay a little more attention to detail for drink prep.<br&gt;<br&gt;By the end of our visit we were left scratching our heads about the hype surrounding Carpenter &amp;amp; Cook. It&amp;#39;s obvious that they have the leisurely come-burn-your-weekend-afternoon-with-us ambiance bit down pat, but food and price wise there&amp;#39;s so much room for improvement you could fit Mariah Carey and her entourage in there. I&amp;#39;d like to think that we visited on an off-day. I guess I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind coming back if I happen to be in the area, though it&amp;#39;ll be an uphill task convincing me to go out of my way to visit Carpenter &amp;amp; Cook a second time."

The texture was smooth &amp;amp; practically melt-in-your-mouth.  The crust was baked to perfection! It&amp;#39;s no surprise to learn that the cook trained in the prestigious Cordon Bleu in London. This is indeed no ordinary Quiche<br&gt;<br&gt;2) Passionfruit Meringue Tart - Another must try item!!! It&amp;#39;s just heaven!!! omg!!! I&amp;#39;ve never been a huge fan of tarts but this one was AMAZING. It took all my will power to not gobble up the whole piece and leave some for Kah Hong to try. I think I managed to leave like 1/4 (at least I tried)... haha... he loved it too!!!  The passionfruit filling was creamy, thick and not-too-sweet. While the crust was crispy and baked to perfection just like the Quiche. <br&gt;<br&gt;3) Drinks - I love the Elderflower soda (makes me think of LOTR for some reason. food for the elves. I am sure they would approve). The Ginger beer was a tad bit too strong for me but Kah seems to be ok with it. He&amp;#39;s the adventurous foodie. Anyways, what a unique selection of sodas they have! Seriously, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve seen them anywhere else in Singapore. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Ambiance<br&gt;Beautiful! Vintage furnitures that has a nostalgic old world, British cafe feel to it :)<br&gt;<br&gt;Tip: Heard it gets pretty crowded on weekends so go early! or on weekdays nights (perfect chill out place after a long day of work)."

Told her it was my first time and she cheerfully recommended a few items, 2 of which I got: lemon tart and bacon quiche. Atmosphere was buzzing, full house but I managed to get a seat.  It&amp;#39;s an amazing throw back to the 20&amp;#39;s, ragtime music, sewing tables and old school advertising. Felt like I was on an episode of The Pickers: everything is for sale. <br&gt;<br&gt;The bad: Quiche was served cold and the so called best lemon tart in Singapore was good but not mind blowing. The custard was spot on, but the crust was too thin and hard. Was also served my latter in a glass...WHY?  This isn&amp;#39;t the only spot that is guilty of this, but I can&amp;#39;t for the life of me figure out why places do this. You should never put hot water in glass. First of all once the heat from the water will go to the surface of the glass causing the glass to absorb heat, making it fire hot.  Secondly, after the glass gets scorching hot, the water gives up heat into the air, reducing the temperature of the water (drink gets cold quick = bad).  Because of this, your drink goes from scorching hot to ice cold faster than you can say Carpenter + Cook, and unfortunately there isn&amp;#39;t enough time to drink it in between.  People don&amp;#39;t just use mugs for the cute handles, it serves a purpose.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The ugly: Carpenter has his stuff together but Cook needs to step up their game just a bit and really wow with the food. That&amp;#39;s the difference between 3, 4 and 5 stars: the wow factor.  Although I enjoyed 20+ minutes of old timer songs, I don&amp;#39;t think I could handle much more. I don&amp;#39;t know how those employees do it...but perhaps that&amp;#39;s what makes them so smiley...they&amp;#39;ve gone insane from the tunes."

I am no cafe spotter, but as a fourth year (and very restless) undergraduate with too much time on my hands, the easy excuse of &amp;#34;coffee hunting&amp;#34; has brought me to coffee haunts in all corners of Singapore. Now that with one just minutes from my house- there was simply no excuse to not go.<br&gt;<br&gt;I decided to check out the place with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. Being familiar with the area we did not have any trouble locating the place, but I can imagine how the unassuming shopfront (very dark tinted windows) might be easily missed by first-timers, especially since the cafe is modestly nestled among rows of tuition centres. Even then, any trouble would be well worth your while the moment you step in- the place is warmly lit, the air is cool and well ventilated (I have a thing about smelling like the food I just ate). The decor of the place was lovely (lovely china and well-done vintage without a hint of gaudiness). Many of the ornaments and furniture are for sale, hence the &amp;#34;Carpenter&amp;#34; in &amp;#34;Carpenter &amp;amp; Cook&amp;#34;.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food looks absolutely delicious - tarts, pastries, cakes, coffee/teas (there isn&amp;#39;t really any savoury food). I would have ordered every pastry available just from the way they looked- but having come from a heavy lunch, we eventually compromised on a lemon tart, a long black and an iced latte. The lemon tart definitely convinced me to make a return visit. It is is possibly my favorite lemon tart right now! It was simple- exactly how I wished it was- a sturdy pastry (perhaps a bit too hard for some) filled with a really smooth lemon curd. I won&amp;#39;t go so far as to say it completely blew my mind- but if you&amp;#39;ve ever had a great pastry that made your toes curl, you&amp;#39;d totally get it. The coffee also did not disappoint- even my friend who is very much of a coffee snob remarked that it was &amp;#39;not too bad at all&amp;#39;."

Alas, being too lazy to DIY has its downsides. <br&gt;<br&gt;How it works is that you order and pay, and are handed a buzzer that flashes and vibrates violently when your order is ready. The coffee is always aromatic and smooth, and served with an old school Iced Gem biscuit. On the other hand, the breakfast&amp;#39;s standard tends to vary from day to day.

A great thing to order on a hot sunny day!!<br&gt;<br&gt;They serve their mains here after 4pm and that is when the weather gets cooler, the crowd starts to flow in and you can just enjoy the Holland Village vibe. Food overall is not the main draw but rather how the place makes you feel. I wouldnt mind turning up again."

Nothing to write home to your mother about really. <br&gt;<br&gt;The good thing about Breko is its informal atmosphere. At night, it becomes really lively, with customers occupying the alfresco tables, chatting and people watching. Oh, yes. People watching. Breko is fantastic for that.

While walking down a cute road with many food and drink options, I decided to stop into Breko because of their 1 for 1 beer special for $12. Two beers for $12 in Singapore is a steal, seeing as drinking in this town can be quite expensive. Their food menu was pretty impressive as well. I decided to grab their fish fillet and waffle fries while my wife decided on a pasta dish. Both came out well presented and tasted good. We ordered a couple rounds of Corona&amp;#39;s as well which went great with our food. Overall, the food was good and the beer special was awesome.

Do not come expecting michelin star worthy cuisine and you will not be disappointed. It serves the usual bistro fare - burgers, cordon bleu, sausages, sweet cakes. Nothing to write home to your mother about really. <br&gt;<br&gt;The good thing about Breko is its informal atmosphere. At night, it becomes really lively, with customers occupying the alfresco tables, chatting and people watching. Oh, yes. People watching. Breko is fantastic for that.

The place looks livelier and the coffee tastes much better. Similar to most &amp;#39;Western&amp;#39; coffee joints (I use the term &amp;#39;Western&amp;#39; to feel more as one with the locals), 6oz sells cakes, sandwiches, chips, etc. During lunchtime, they have gourmet sandwiches, aka fancy carbs + fancy meat. I haven&amp;#39;t tried the sandwiches just yet, but I might buy considering the lattes are roughly $5, and if I pay $7 more for the &amp;#39;lunch combo,&amp;#39; I get a sandwich. Still a bit pricey in my book, especially considering the healthier option of Happy Salad upstairs. <br&gt;<br&gt;My tip? Eat lunch at Happy Salad and have coffee at 6oz. I vote for that salted carmel latte-yummy! <br&gt; <br&gt;Espressos come in 6 oz and coffee in either 8oz or 12oz."

Except outside is also air-conditioned within an enclosed space!<br&gt;<br&gt;Was there on a saturday and it was really nice and quiet for a weekend. The best thing is that it opens til late. There were a few students studying here when I was there, it is quite the perfect place to study undisturbed! <br&gt;<br&gt;Their specialty here is the pretzels and they looked irresistible in the menu pictures that I ordered a stuffed pepperoni pretzel. The ordering system is interesting to say the least. You get this electronic tag after you order at the counter and make your payment. You sit down and wait for your tag to light up and beep and then collect your food and drink from the counter. It&amp;#39;s pretty troublesome to go to and fro if you&amp;#39;re seated out in the enclosed space, you have to keep opening doors. But I suppose that&amp;#39;s forgivable if the food and drinks are top notch. But it&amp;#39;s really not. The coffee I had was uninspiring, for a store that calls itself a coffee place, they&amp;#39;ve got a long way to go. The pretzel however was quite a delight - it was served hot with the cheese all gooey and melting and the dough was soft. The only other thing I remember was how pricey the piece of dough cost!<br&gt;<br&gt;Final verdict: Great for studying! Though I don&amp;#39;t think the store is an advocate of it."

It was crispy and light so you would probably want to have it all for yourself instead of sharing it. It did not taste too heavy or filling either. A perfect snack. The maple syrup could be more but then again, the ice cream would sweeten it too.<br&gt;<br&gt;The hazelnut and coconut ice cream were so delicious. The hazelnut was like eating rocher chocolate and the coconut had tiny bits of coconut pieces. My friend likened it to the coconut ice cream at Chatterbox in Mandarin Orchard Hotel of a few years ago (not as good now).<br&gt;<br&gt;The hazelnut and coconut ice cream were from the premium range so there was an additional dollar to each scoop. <br&gt;<br&gt;You could also help yourself to iced water from the cooler in a corner.

Rabbit Owl Depot turns one this week and coincidentally, it was also my friend&amp;#39;s birthday so we decided to celebrate it over there with a group of friends.<br&gt;I loved their decor, it is such a cute and heart-warming feeling, walking into Rabbit Owl Depot. <br&gt;<br&gt;They have a wide range of ice cream flavours. All were great! It was so hard trying to pick a flavour or two for our ice creams!<br&gt;Somethings to note about ROD,they do not use any preservatives for their ice cream, and essential additives such as stabilizers are kept to a minimum! Which means, you are consuming &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ice cream!! Enjoy!!<br&gt;<br&gt;Despite the cafe being small and only able to accomodate 20 pax, the owners were very friendly and allowed me to make a reservation for 7 pax. They even helped me put the cake in the fridge and only when we were done with the cake, that they started to make the waffles. How thoughtful!<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Waffle with Chocolate Banana and Hazelnut Rocher $12.50<br&gt;Moving straight to the waffles, first up was the chocolate banana and hazelnut rocher. I loved the chocolate banana, it was like BJs chunky monkey, just creamier! <br&gt;Everyone was blown away at how crispy the waffles were! I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m going to get alot of them requesting to bring them back here! The texture of the waffles were very brown on the outisde and yet not burnt. On the inside, the waffles were mostly hollow, so you probably can&amp;#39;t get full from the waffles either. <br&gt;<br&gt;2. Chocolate waffles with Berry Cheese $10.50<br&gt;The chocolate waffles were slightly softer and fluffier than the original snowflake waffle. The chocolate waffles were sweet with chocolate chips in them. It was a nice combination with the berry cheese ice cream which wasn&amp;#39;t too cheesey and had the right amount of berry flavour without it tasting sour! I think Rabbit Owl Depot, has got it&amp;#39;s mixture spot on!<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Waffle with Wake-me-up and Hunny Bunny  $13.50<br&gt;As a coffee lover, I was looking forward to the wake-me-up but it tasted a tad too sweet for my liking. But nonetheless the hunny bunny was a favourite amongst the group too! It was like a honey flavoured ice cream with an intense smooth aftertaste!<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Waffle with Sticky Salt Caramel and Cookie Jingle $13.50<br&gt;The salted caramel wasn&amp;#39;t as salty as you would expect, instead I tasted more of the caramel than the the salt. Together with the cookie jingle, which was my favourite. The salted caramel&amp;#39;s saltiness was enhanced! For cookies and cream lovers, the cookie jingle is for you!<br&gt;<br&gt;Crispy snowflake wafflesI am still amazed at how deliciously crispy and yet savoury these waffles were! They sprinkle icing sugar over it for a slight added sweetness but the sweet aroma of these buttermilk waffles are addictive!<br&gt;<br&gt;Quite a reasonable spend for about 7 of us to have a hearty spread of ice cream and waffles!<br&gt;Overall : The ice cream were rich, smooth and didn&amp;#39;t melt quickly. The waffles were super crispy and you will be amazed by their snowflake waffles! Their prices are reasonable and they have a comfortable dining area too!"

I ordered 2 flavours - one premium one usual - with the triple waffles ( small pieces )which came up to $18. <br&gt;<br&gt;2. Staff was ok and doing what he needed to do but.... made me not want to ask him for more flavours trials lol... U know what I mean.... If he had been a bit more accommodating, I would have ordered more premium flavours actually... Also when I asked if the original flavoured waffle came with syrup, he just stated that it is on the waffle...and there was just one other customer who was done paying up so he wasn&amp;#39;t busy till he could not have just offered more syrup or a smile. Lol! I think good service makes customers come back for more since there are so many ice cream shops we can choose to go otherwise."

Love the &amp;#34;themed&amp;#34; furniture with the pipe details. I&amp;#39;m so over that array of mismatched furniture thing that seems to be all the rage. It&amp;#39;s sloppy! There are little owl/rabbit knick knacks around the cafe that I find adorable. Again, that running theme which just shows careful thought. <br&gt;<br&gt;We shared a snowflake waffle with ice cream. Yum. Yknow how it is with &amp;#34;the basics&amp;#34;. Anyone can make cakes, pancakes, toast etc. But the true test is to have it sans any &amp;#34;taste boosters&amp;#34;. The waffle by itself is already tasty. Drizzled sparsely with icing sugar and syrup (overkill with the sweetness and it&amp;#39;d have been MEH) and the ice cream... Mm. Also appreciate how the waffles are a little on the crisp side, just the way I like them.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;d say the star is the waffles, but hey, the coffee is pretty good too!

I brought it back to the guy behind the counter (he looks like an ah beng but was so gentle and soft-spoken! Surprise!) and asked if he could add more ice as it was too sweet. Without a word, he proceeded to add more ice and even top up our tea! I was shocked! He then passed me the cup and said that he added more tea &amp;#39;on the house&amp;#39; to balance the flavour. This is what I call excellent pro-activeness and good service!<br&gt;<br&gt;The only downside (that&amp;#39;s why my review is 4 stars!) was that they still give plastic cups/straws even though customers opted to dine in.

I like the two of them must have eaten a lot, lol!!<br&gt;<br&gt;After my lunch at Sanpoutei today, I was taken to PS Cafe at Palais Renaissance. I walked by a display of cakes. They are not necessary the kind of cakes I like but still...<br&gt;<br&gt;FOOD 3/5<br&gt;I suggested we both shared the Flourless Orange Cake with Orange butterscotch sauce. It would be too much for me to polish that whole cake. The cake came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was alright. Nothing to write home about. The Oreo milkshake was good, but is it even possible to mess up a milk shake?<br&gt;<br&gt;AMBIENCE 3/5<br&gt;My first impression of this café? There are so many steps in this place. It is crazy!! I should put a PSA here. This place is not wheelchair friendly. It is not friendly to anyone who has mobility issue. It was rather crowded when we entered the café. <br&gt;<br&gt;It was a lovely place with lots of greenery. I wanted to love the place but.. the back of leather couch was leaning on the back of another couch sat by another patron. It was not the heaviest chair, so I was extra careful making sure my couch remained in place and not disturb the patron behind me. I was not comfortable throughout my dessert session. The patrons behind me were not as considerate as I hoped to be. <br&gt;<br&gt;SERVICE 4/5<br&gt;I took off a star since it was so hard to holler down a staff to take our order. Other than that, the staffs were nice and polite. <br&gt;<br&gt;Would I return to this PS Café for anything? I doubt it. I have taken a good look at the menu, no wonder my sis spent over $100 for breakfast.

We put our names down on their iPad checkin system, but we waited for half an hour without being seated even though the place had a couple of empty tables. We went up there and asked a server how long more we would have to wait (we were the only customers waiting), and she said another half an hour in a pretty flippant manner and walked away. We got pretty confused then, since we were told that the wait was half an hour pretty much half an hour earlier, and now we&amp;#39;re supposed to wait another half an hour? When she came back we told her our name was in the system, and only then she led us to a free table.<br&gt;<br&gt;My friend ordered the same salad as I did, and told them to leave out the rocket. The waiter noted that down and said it was no problem. When the salad came surprise surprise it came chock full of rocket leaves. We called the waiter back and he said the kitchen premixes the salad, so they couldn&amp;#39;t take it out. Well before I get started on a kitchen that premixes a $25 salad, if you can&amp;#39;t take out the rocket at least let us know before you serve it and ask if we&amp;#39;re still ok with having it.<br&gt;<br&gt;I only took away 1 star because the food is good although it is pricey, but I really hope the service improves."

It&amp;#39;s conveniently located in Palais Renaissance so I stopped by after a haircut (there are several salon&amp;#39;s here that are all excellent by the way), hoping for a quick bite. In short, the food was fantastic, but the service was terrible.<br&gt;<br&gt;I have two pet peeves when dining out. My first has to be the impatient server. You know the kind: talking to you while not talking to you, looking boredly around the room while in conversation with you. This was the first impression we had as the server took our orders.<br&gt;<br&gt;We stopped here for a quick bite with the intention of the meal being, well, &amp;#39;quick.&amp;#39; It was anything but. After we were seated and our orders taken, we were virtually ignored for an hour or two. Not just us, but the entire section where we were seated. A little odd, especially since it was barely even half full, and there were always at least five servers standing at the entrance talking to each other. And every time we would try to hail a waiter, it would take several minutes, despite there being no other tables being served.<br&gt;<br&gt;My second pet peeve has to be specific inconsistent attention. What I mean by this is when you are virtually ignored for your entire meal, only to have a server on winged feet when paying for the check. Unfortunately, this was again what happened during our visit to this restaurant. As soon as I asked for the bill, the server speedily appeared, and remained hovering until it was paid.<br&gt;<br&gt;To be fair though, the food was excellent. The burger had just the right amount of juices flowing with each bite, and every plate was picked clean. The smoothie I ordered tasted a little bland, but maybe I was just regretting not ordering the milkshake.<br&gt;<br&gt;As we walked out, my girlfriend mentioned that the other branch she had visited of the same chain had much better service. Or maybe just service in general, especially considering the one here was virtually nonexistent. With that in mind, I would gladly recommend this chain, just not this particular location. And after skimming through some of the other reviews, one easily can find many examples of bad service and questionable management.<br&gt;<br&gt;Good food, overall, but when you&amp;#39;re paying high prices for such bad service, why bother? Especially when you really are spoiled for choice in the food heaven that is Singapore."

It&amp;#39;s the perfect place to hang out after a day of shopping and it&amp;#39;s quiet (Harding is really noisy) and airy (unlike the claustrophobic Paragon and A.S.H outlets). There&amp;#39;s a choice of outdoor seating which is a good option if the weather is not overly humid. It looks good and smells good. Boy do i love the lilies in the toilet.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food at PS is not fantastic though the portions are huge. I like the crab tart (which is only served at Palais). Their quiche (varies from day to day) is a hit and miss-  dry tart and the tart to filling ratio isn&amp;#39;t perfect (too much of the former). Their brunch menu is also rather forgettable. <br&gt;<br&gt;So why do i keep going back? For the desserts of course! Their cakes are quite consistent and so far they haven&amp;#39;t failed me when i have a sweet craving. I love the steamed apple pudding with butterscotch sauce and real vanilla ice cream. Tender juicy caramelized apple chunks on top of a warm brown sponge that soaks up that butterscotch sauce and neutralized with a fragrant vanilla ice cream- it&amp;#39;s an explosion of taste and texture. This is only available at Palais as well (another reason to go there!). I don&amp;#39;t like their sticky date pudding at Harding, too much of the date skin which really scratches the throat. Dates are also too sweet for my liking."

The one thing that I am a great fan of is their seared tuna salad. I love how japanese flavours are incorporated into this salad with the wasabi vinaigrette. The fish was fresh and well seared and the whole combination of ingredients made it tasty, fresh and light. I tried their chocolate cake once but felt that it was pretty run-of-the-mill and not worth its expensive price tag.<br&gt;<br&gt;I would not actually visit PS Cafe for their food, but I would come back for a nice chilled afternoon for a cup of coffee to enjoy the wonderful ambience."

I was hungry so I scoped what is around and landed here. <br&gt;<br&gt;A lady approached me and lured me into ordering from her food stand. I was actually looking to order my first bowl of soup but the curry rice won me over. For under $5 SGD, I got a plate packed full of carbohydrates, proteins, and fat. Though the curry was a bit watery but it had some heat and was quite delicious. The fried pork chop was tough as a rock but the over-easy egg took this dish to another level. I love eggs on everything! The fried chicken was juicy. The lady asked if I wanted fish, I thanked her but declined but she still threw some in... =/ I did not eat it because it looked slimy. It was steamed. <br&gt;<br&gt;I enjoyed it. Her smile and talkative nature was definitely unique compared to the other folks working behind the counter. Nothing more comforting than a plate of curry rice. Oh my... I wish I was back in Singapore."

Char Kway Teow', 'width': 180, 'height': 180, 'caption': 'Char Kway Teow'}]",Gin Y.,en,"My first impression when coming to this particular hawker center was that it was extremely overwhelming and big. There were over 200 food stalls to choose from here. It was daunting to find what we wanted to eat. When we found a stall we liked a lot, we made a note of its exact location on GoogleMaps so we didn&amp;#39;t have to find it again next time. Thankfully, one of these food stalls was quite popular and traceable on GoogleMaps (Lian He Ben Ji Claypot). <br&gt;<br&gt;That being said, the food was pretty amazing here. The claypot rice took the longest time to come to us, since the stall made it as we ordered it. It was probably an hour before we were able to eat it. As we waited for the claypot rice, we ate various other items like their laksa, satay, and charkway teow (stir fried beef noodles). All were good. But, the standout was that laksa! Man oh man was that the creamiest laksa I&amp;#39;ve ever had in my life. The broth looked more like a cream sauce with the huge amount of shrimp roe they placed in. The noodles had great texture, and close to spaghetti. It was perfect for all that creamy soup to coat around it. Every bite was heaven. Great shrimp, coconut, and lemongrass flavors coming through. It was quite possibly my favorite dish at this hawker center, and in Singapore overall. The satay was good, but it wasn&amp;#39;t as aromatic as the satay at Satay by the Bay. I still enjoyed eating it while I gulped down my bottle of ice cold Coke Zero (it was so freaking hot, and there&amp;#39;s no AC at all). The charkway teow had some great wok hey (aka flavor from the heat of the wok). But, I wished the noodles were bouncier and held their shape. They were just kind of soggy. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, our claypot rice arrived, and they were huge. The stall didn&amp;#39;t understand my brother, and they made double the order of claypot rice for us. Safe to say we were stuffed by the end of this dinner. Too much food! But, the claypot rice was amazing. From the rice, to the Chinese sausages, to the salted fish, to the chicken, it was all fragrant and delicious. Definitely pour that dark soy sauce all over this claypot rice and mix all the ingredients well. What&amp;#39;s best is to combine some crispy rice that&amp;#39;s created from the bottom of the claypot with the soft rice. It was yummy. <br&gt;<br&gt;Definitely come here when you have a specific goal about what to eat. Be patient as well, since navigating this massive center can be exhausting. Please get some cold drinks as this place doesn&amp;#39;t have AC, and you will wither way from the heat and humidity. You could go to the mall and get food in the comforts of AC. But, you can bear the heat and have some really delicious (and definitely more affordable food) at this Hawker Center. Come check his spot out."

Conveniently located in Chinatown, this is a great place to stop by for a bite to eat after you&amp;#39;re done with souvenir shopping / exploration in Chinatown. For the food, simply go to the second floor, and bam! You&amp;#39;ll be greeted with food stalls upon food stalls and the delicious smell of various food wafting around.<br&gt;<br&gt;As a tourist, I was pretty overwhelmed at what to eat and where to start. My suggestion to anyone who hasn&amp;#39;t been to a hawker center before is to walk around first and observe the food prior to just jumping to a stall and ordering right away. Since the place was quite big, it did take some time for my friends and me to explore the different food stalls and making mental notes at which ones we wanted to try. Best plan when traveling with a group of people is to pick a general eating spot, split up, get whatever food you desire, and regroup at the eating area. The eating area itself is scattered around with tables and chairs. <br&gt;<br&gt;For the food stalls, there was a huge variety that ranged from only fresh fruit smoothies / drinks to various cuisines like Chinese, Indian, Singaporean, Indonesian and etc. If you need food suggestions, simply go line up for food stalls that have huge lines. Most likely, these food stalls are either popular with locals/tourists, or the food is pretty cheap and tasty. I used this tactic and ended up with delicious food that I at first, had no idea what I was eating. <br&gt;<br&gt;For food here, I highly recommend lining up for the Food Street Fried Kway Teow Mee. Simply put, it&amp;#39;s noodles mixed with a spicy like sauce, seafood like taste and such. Not sure what else goes into it, but it is one tasty dish!! To find this stall, look for a long line (or at my picture). The wait is definitely worth it and it&amp;#39;s cool to see the chef in action on making your meal. As for drinks, pretty much most of the drinks stalls have similar prices (price average around $1-3). As for another random dish I tried, the green bean rice dumping at the Jia Ji Mei Shi food stall was amazingly good. With its sticky rice texture on the outside, and the green bean taste mixed in with the meat and rice......man, this was so yummy and at the same, mad filling on the tummy. If you do order this dish, I highly recommend getting the sweet and spicy chili sauce with it. So good. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, prices for most food stalls is pretty cheap (with a few exceptions on higher end seafood dishes) and you do get the option of picking your portion sizes that range from small to large. I spent roughly $5 that landed me 2 food items + 2 drinks and that alone made me go into a food coma. Make sure you bring cash since most places don&amp;#39;t take credit cards.<br&gt;<br&gt;After eating, I recommend checking out the first floor where it&amp;#39;s like a mini clothing market that sells various clothes and small trinkets :)"

Especially now that one of the stalls that&amp;#39;s been there donkeys years won a michelin star.. being non singas I just love hawker centre food.. to all non locals... follow the pack. If u see a line it generally is pretty darn good!! tonight I ventured here in search of the Michelin star Soya Chicken rice... But was too late.. all finito before 5pm already! was on my own and scouted slot of things I wanted to try due to noticeable local popularity.... I ate ... <br&gt;<br&gt;FUKIEN MEIN ... heard some loud crazy wok action and smelt the &amp;#34;鑊氣&amp;#34; ! Turned the corner and noticed a line forming decided to get into the action.. had this already at Lau pasat but this one was better. The noodles and gravy had that extra flavour due to more of the 鑊氣. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was actually content BUT saw another line so I mosied up behind an uncle ... and raised my victory fingers when asked how many cus my mouth was drawing a long sip if the sour sop!! <br&gt;<br&gt;2 X POPIAH... I would have to say one of the best so far... in SG if u want to ward off vampires eat their popiahs.. man they use a lot of garlic. But at this stall it was the right amount of everything. sauce garlic and the crunchy thingy bob<br&gt;<br&gt;Soursop.. um watered down but still decent for $2<br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken rice.. the line was getting crazy luckily I joined 5 min early otherwise would be waiting around corner. Again hmmmm chicken was good but rice was a let down.. <br&gt;<br&gt;had to waddle out..

Especially the dining area. Very bottom floor is the wet market while the shops are street level, and hawker stalls are upper level. I&amp;#39;m reviewing the hawker stalls. If you&amp;#39;ve got friends who all have different tastes, this might be a good option. Everyone can buy what they went then regroup at the table.<br&gt;<br&gt;Lots and lots of stalls mainly catering to the older demographic, which means some of these stalls have been around for a long time and are tried and true. Open air but densely packed (with both the hot stalls and people) so it can get really muggy and uncomfortable during peak hours. Just expect to sweat. Also, there are toilets somewhere in the middle, and I think it&amp;#39;s ten cents for entry.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s impossible to give an average rating of the food since there are so many stalls, which should ideally be individually rated, but overall, prices are very reasonable. Some stalls only open in the afternoon, so if you&amp;#39;re coming for a particular place make sure you know what time they open (e.g., claypot place only opens after 3pm/4pm). My favorite is one of the herbal soup places. But I say go around and try what you want, don&amp;#39;t necessarily join a queue just because you think if there&amp;#39;s a line it must be good.<br&gt;<br&gt;The wet market is worth checking out if you want to buy some fruits to eat back in your lodging. Prices for tropical fruits are way less than what you&amp;#39;d pay in your home country. And if you ask, the vendor will cut off the extra twigs for you after weighing so you have less to carry and less to throw away back at the hotel."

The tables are color coded according to which area they&amp;#39;re in - makes it much easier if you&amp;#39;re trying to find a friend. <br&gt;<br&gt;Everyone (or most people) would know about the newly minted Michelin newbie Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken, and if you don&amp;#39;t you&amp;#39;d likely see the line snaking across three rows of stores (estimated wait now: 2 hours at lunch time). Other fave picks: <br&gt;<br&gt;1) An Ji - well known for its zichar dishes - the wait may be long but worth it! I particularly liked their fish sliced noodles soup with incredibly thick and fragrant soup (without tasting too milky). The beef noodles with gravy had wok hei and I loved the thick sauce ladled over it. <br&gt;<br&gt;2) Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao - check out the separate Yelp listing. Solid and affordable Xiaolongbaos at $5.50 for 10. Not sure if a better deal for xlb exists?!? <br&gt;<br&gt;3) Food Street Char Kway Teow - It seems to be the only store specializing in char kway teow and its gooood. The lines are long at dinner or peak hours but decent for the rest of the day (of course, Outram Park Char kway Teow is just around the corner too). This is a more wet-style of frying. <br&gt;<br&gt;4) Jin Ji Duck and Kway Chap - nestled in the corner near the red tables (and unfortunately, also a sizable population of pigeons sigh), recognizable by the newspaper articles hung on the store. They offer yam rice with braised duck, which is sadly becoming more rare. Their noodles (kway teow) have a chewy and perfect texture too, unlike what you usually get from any random store&amp;#39;s kway teow, and I really enjoyed slurping down the bowl of noodles. The only grouse is that they don&amp;#39;t give very generous portions of duck. <br&gt;<br&gt;5) Tai Hwa Coffee/drinks store - more of a local haunt - many uncles and aunties queueing up here for their kopi! (And my parents first brought me here lol.) Also near the red tables. They make a mean cup of kopi C! Though other types of kopi are also popular: it just depends what you ordinarily order. It&amp;#39;s thick and has a slight burnt taste, and is also very strong. Reminds me of the kopi at Suntec City food court (popular among the CBD crowd). <br&gt;<br&gt;6) boiled soups - near the back entrance above the durian shop on the first floor. It&amp;#39;s not often you find boiled Chinese-style soups like old cucumber or watercress. I&amp;#39;m not a diehard fan of these soups but great if you&amp;#39;re in the mood for some lighter fare! <br&gt;<br&gt;Because carrot cake is my all-time fave hawker dish, the ones I&amp;#39;ve tried from Super Mommy store and another one near the green tables are both pretty decent. Not the best, not something I&amp;#39;d travel for, but authentic and satisfies the craving. <br&gt;<br&gt;The best way to eat at a hawker center IMO is to split many dishes with friends!"

I enhanced this selection with a nice selection of satay from a nearby hawker stall. Squid and chicken satay? Why yes, I don&amp;#39;t mind if I do. Smith Street also has clean seating on the side of the street, and they seem to do a nice job of cleaning up the tables as soon as someone leaves.<br&gt;<br&gt;However, as good as Smith Street is, it can get a bit sticky for it is outside after all, and unlike a hawker stand, searching for a toilet can be a bit problematic. Still, besides a cornucopia munching to be had, Smith Street is also lined with a number of souvenir shops and specialty items; purchase some Chinese herbs for some old school healing. All and all, Smith Street is a nice change from a typical hawker center."

The ground floor is basically a huge market, which is effectively the extension of the rest of the markets in Chinatown, and in the basement is where all you do you food shopping, however if you are looking for a bite to eat it is on the second level where you head because there are simply so many stalls here you just do not know where to begin. Mind you, this is Singapore, so it isn&amp;#39;t like your local food hall where you buy your lunch (or dinner) and one of the stalls and eat it, but rather you buy selections of food from the various stalls scattered around. One will sell Chinese, another Indian, another desert, and another drinks (including beer). You then take your purchases to one of the many tables and prepare for a feast. Mind you, it is quite loud in here, but the smells are amazing, and if you are here after six, make sure you go and check out the Good Beer Company (and Smith Street Taps)."

There is a Seafood Stall that&amp;#39;s really famous at the end of the street - it sells Ikan Bakar, Deep Fried Baby Squid, and quite a few other local delicacies. The City Satay stall is FAB!!!

For some people, its a 5 star place in terms of the soup. <br&gt;<br&gt;What is a let down for me is that the meat is not as soft as it should be. The fatty pork trotters is not really a tear-off the-bone kinda deal and below average in terms of tear-of-ness, while the pork ribs is also below average in terms of that. <br&gt;<br&gt;Nonetheless this place is a sell-out during lunch time. The stallowners do have a rather good service in terms of reserving seats for you with their own tissue papers."

Wanted to rave about one of my favourite places in Orchard Road, but just didn&amp;#39;t get to do it till now (excuses I know hahahahah). <br&gt;<br&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s the story. Celebrated my birthday at this cafe in May this year with my gal friends. 4 of us ordered a few mains and a dessert to share. I gotta say we were all very happy with the food. I especially love the 2 main dishes: Fuwa Fuwa Hoshino Soufflé with Porcini Rissoto Tomato Cream and Omu Rice with Shrimp &amp;amp; Mozarella. Just writing about them and looking at their yelp pictures are making me hungry now. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their dessert item, Double Pancake Soufflé Style is also recommended. It is so big I am sure it can feed 8 instead of the 4 of us. Love the service here! Definitely one of the few places in SG where you can enjoy good and cheery service at a mid-priced eatery. Good service is just super hard to find in SG #sadfactoflife.<br&gt;<br&gt;I have been coming to this cafe chain over the years. My favourite outlet is still this Plaza Singapura one. After writing this review, I have the urge to visit it soon. Think I gotta make it real soon. #whydoeswritingreviewsmakeonehungry?"

Entrance', 'width': 180, 'height': 180, 'caption': 'Entrance'}]",Melissa Y.,en,"Located on the third floor extension of Plaza Singapura, is Hoshino Coffee, a popular Japanese chain of coffee shop. I wanted to try this so badly at Shibuya but time did not allow. So back here in Singapore, I decided to go all out and try it!! 7 soufflés ordered and here goes my personal soufflé buffet!! &amp;#34;Gotta catch em all!&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;Now that is supposedly Spring in Japan, even though my Japanese friends told me it snowed last week and it&amp;#39;s currently 6 degrees celsius in Tokyo, the Spring menu for Hoshino coffee includes this super pretty pink  strawberry soufflé pancake!<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Hoshino&amp;#39;s Spring Pancake Soufflé $14.50++<br&gt;So after the waitress took our 7 orders of soufflés, all the 4 pancakes arrived at all table all at once! The strawberry ice cream was very smooth, it wasn&amp;#39;t too sweet but the syrup they provided us was very sweet indeed! Use it sparingly over the soufflé, as it can drown out your taste buds and we had 6 more soufflés to try and we didn&amp;#39;t want to kill our taste buds. The soufflé itself is alot harder than the normally fluffly soufflé. As it is a pancake, I would consider it more like a fluffier and slightly tougher version of a chiffon cake.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Pancake Soufflé with Chocolate Banana $13.50++<br&gt;Lots of chocolate sauce going on here. When you order a pancake soufflé, you have an option of whipped cream of softee. We went with softee for all our pancake soufflés and we liked the softee. Japanese soft serves, you can never go wrong with them! The pancake soufflé don&amp;#39;t have any fillings inside, unlike the hot vanilla soufflés.<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Pancake Soufflé with Mango $13.50++<br&gt;We decided to go easy on the syrup for this one, having tried the first Spring soufflé with syrup and the second one with alot of chocolate sauce. The softee itself isn&amp;#39;t very sweet, as such you can taste the subtle sweetness of the soufflé pancake!<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Pancake Soufflé with Matcha &amp;#34;Ogura&amp;#34; Bean Paste $13.50++<br&gt;The most modest of the pancake soufflés, and my personal favourite. The matcha soft cream here tastes very similar to the one I tried at Tsujiri, it has a stronger bitter after taste than the typical sweet and sugar-ladden matcha ice cream. The bean paste is also very sweet, as such, be careful not to get a sugar-overdose trying to eat that on it&amp;#39;s own! <br&gt;<br&gt;5. Vanilla Soufflé with Chocolate/Custard/Matcha sauce $10.80++ each<br&gt;All the vanilla soufflés arrived at our table just as we were done with the pancake soufflé!<br&gt;<br&gt;You gotta pour the sauces into the soufflé and the soufflé was steaming hot as we sliced it open, and even as we dug in, each spoonful, you could still see it steaming!! It is a very hot dessert, and be careful not to burn your tongue!<br&gt;<br&gt;Of the 3 sauces, my favourite was custard. It had the right amount of sweetness! The chocolate was abit too sweet for my liking and the green tea wasn&amp;#39;t sweet at all!<br&gt;<br&gt;and here&amp;#39;s the bill for our exploration of 7 soufflés at Hoshino coffee!!<br&gt;<br&gt;Service is pretty good here, there&amp;#39;s a button for your to press and the waitress will come to you. The also provide you with a bag to put your things."

Around 15 mins. Waiting for the food was abit slower. Service was kinda average. They had service bell on the table but they were kinda useless. It is much faster raising your hands and getting service. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service staff serving our table had limited knowledge of English so asking her questions like &amp;#39;do you sell the coffee beans&amp;#39; needed another staff to help. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food wise it was a hit and miss. I had the demi-glacé omu rice. The sauce was decent but the proportion of the rice to the sauce was inbalanced. I think they should give more sauce or reduce the size of the dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;The dessert was a letdown. I had the creme brûlée. The dessert was not made on the spot since the crust sugar was cold on taste. <br&gt;<br&gt;Price wise I find it a tad expensive.

Fuwa-Fuwa Hoshino Souffle ($15.80)  - My favorite! I tried this based on Angeline C&amp;#39;s recommendation and she was right on spot. This was definitely a unique dish. It has an amazing, light scrambled-eggs-buttery flavor. My only complain would be there was too little meat in it (barely half a dozen small sausage cubes). <br&gt;<br&gt;2. Omelette rice with beef sauce - Average. <br&gt;<br&gt;3. Matcha souffle with softie ice-cream - I love the souffle but it was a bit wet towards the end when I got to the bottom of the bowl. Also, I would have preferred a stronger match flavor. The softie ice-cream was all melted and running when they served it which was a let down. <br&gt;<br&gt;4. Pancake souffle - It tasted more like a sponge cake than a souffle but it was still worth a try. Interesting concept for a pancake. <br&gt;<br&gt;5. Hoshino Pot Baked Curry Rice - served with eggs (a little more undercooked than the typical sunny-side up style), sausage and some brocoli. Good. I like the way the egg was wet &amp;amp; runny :) They were more generous with the sausage helpings in this dish too. I think I saw a full sausage. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, an interesting japanese fusion restaurant. I like the creative concepts of mixing up dishes like the pancake-souffle and the  Fuwa-Fuwa Hoshino Souffle (which was like a savory souffle crossed with baked rice). I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve tried this anywhere else so definitely worth a check out :) The queue gets pretty crazy at dinner time. Best to come  before the dinner crowd (6.30pm should be safe)."

U wouldn&amp;#39;t believe that the queue speaks for itself. I&amp;#39;d thought, well, it could be that people are simply curious about what this 2 week&amp;#39;s old is capable of. And when the line starts to form, more people just keep queuing without a single complain. It was a late lunch thingy after a movie show, I make my way to this little cafe joint speedily. This is like crazy, the snaking line - almost a L-shaped by now is still around. I have seen the same this morning at 11.10m (the outlet only open at 11.30am!) when I drop by to ask if I could make a reservation for 3pm but was turned down politely, which now I clearly understand why. I know this is what I have to eat despite still nursing my throat discomfort &amp;amp; joined the queue - determined to know if they are as good as they claimed.<br&gt;<br&gt;The interior is not entirely small but having a 3 separate dining space. The main hall sits most of the diners with wooden table and leather padded seats. It emits a brighter and casual feel, probably the area is not constraint by a stiff ceiling but an architectural glass rooftop in the mall that illuminates the stretch with a natural glow of sunlight. There are 4 booth seats which is most ideal for a gals-get-together session, I figured. <br&gt;<br&gt;The menu was straight forward, without fanciful hard to understand dishes. Zoom right into my orders and wave for the staff, the lady clad in chef suit came to me (gosh, even one works in the kitchen has to take time to manage the hall during peak hours?).. aw.. but she was very well-mannered and patient when confronted with inquiries. In fact, no one was seen idling - all the wait person served with pride, promptly and in an unhurried manner. A remarkable service team.<br&gt;<br&gt;I admit I felt a little uneasy when I picked that unfamiliar dish - Fuwa Fuwa. But the truth tells me that feeling has been unwarranted.The most raved about  &amp;#34;fluffy savory soufflé&amp;#34; seriously did not put to shame. Not only that it enticed me with its huge golden puffy bonnet but I was completely sold by its astonishing delicate flavors  This is one dish I wish I had on my last - cottony &amp;amp; airy, formidable without a trace of deflating. It is no wonder that people called it the &amp;#34;cloud&amp;#34;, but I think it&amp;#39;s me that&amp;#39;s on Cloud 9 at every bite. Instead of baking it like an Italian classic with white sauce, this one has a tomato version in it. It was filled with incredible moments - spooning the whites like a mass destruction into that light feathery foam, trespassing to get to the bed of the baking dish. The gems hidden under these soft foams have never been so right. Tomato sauce infused - each grain was plump, tangy-sweet, not soggy. Its flavor was enhanced by strips of middle eye bacon and mushroom bits. Together with that eggy, Parmesan cheese soufflé, a divine marriage left unchallenged by the sweet version. Impossible not to eat, I think I can have 1 on every other day. <br&gt;<br&gt;A couple of spaghetti dishes if you like, other than &amp;#34;Omu&amp;#34; rice (omelette rice) or sandwiches. I had the Lobster Bisque Soup Spaghetti. A french dish but cooked the Japanese way for a lighter taste. Instead of highly seasoned, this one prepared with tomato and finely chopped mushrooms comes with a milder liquidized cream but rich crustaceans flavor. I find the soup a little offensive (even while its still steaming hot) while my dining partner finds it delicious, so I guess it&amp;#39;s a mixed conclusion. It was not entirely bad - at least the spaghetti is cooked the correct way, I guess I just didn&amp;#39;t have the mood for such a sophisticated seafood thing today.<br&gt;<br&gt;String along with others, I ordered a pancake soufflé, this time a more familiar sweet version! Not the plain ones but a more elaborate classic with a tropical touch. I have been advised to remind the kitchen to start preparing the soufflé when I was half way into my main course. It was like taking a number queue to a soufflé! I was asked to wait for another 15mins by the apologetic service staff. Not an issue at all, I said to myself because the end result was a light and airy inflated sponge that was unforgettable. The only negative I had was the fruits. Upon checking, I learnt that frozen mango fruits are used while the kiwi are fresh produces. I&amp;#39;d prefer ripened fruits atop my dessert, not raw and crunchy. Worst, the mango has a weird over-frozen texture makes them taste rubbery. However, the homemade whipped cream was smooth. And pls do not leave the place without a cup of Hoshino blend.<br&gt;<br&gt;Whaff that strong Hoshino caffeine scent right in front of me - that was one of the distinct characteristic while waiting in line. Carefully selected coffee beans were roasted over direct flame and then hand drip to a good-bodied brew. The blend has got a rather pale flavor  less rich as compared to Oriole&amp;#39;s. Milder acidity but has a lingering smell. I guess the Japanese adores this light perfumery beverage. I am good for that 10g but if anyone wanted an extra brew, there is a 50% off for a refill."

However, this trip made me realise how inefficient communication in the kitchen can actually hold up the queue and upsets diners even though this usually happens in Gordon Ramsay&amp;#39;s Kitchen Nightmares.<br&gt;<br&gt;Speaking of the food, the baked curry rice was delicious as the beef curry sauce was really thick and savoury. The soft egg yolk enhances the richness of the rice. It has been years ago since I had my Japanese curry rice.<br&gt;<br&gt;The pancake souffle is nothing spectacular and was a little tad dry and less fluffy than a mc pancake. Hence had to rely on the brown sugar syrup to finish this although they gave us the maple syrup which we did not choose. The puny little salted whipped cream was definitely not enough to go with the pancake. But to pay for extra cream? Definitely no way. <br&gt;<br&gt;Fortunately, the matcha souffle saved the day. Even though it did not rise to a considerable height, it was filled with sweet matcha custard and thus this warm pud was really comforting one to enjoy. The only dish that I would recommend one to try.<br&gt;<br&gt;In short, this place is definitely not worth queuing so better to avoid peak hours. I think it is very adventurous or bold for a newly opened restaurant to offer so many soufflé items as they require long waiting time. However, this must be provided that the orders run smoothly without missing out or leaving out any item, only to have realized that the kitchen had left out the order after customers&amp;#39; reminders."

The only thing she did was apologize and then run away, leaving her colleagues to deal with the mess!! HOW RUDE! <br&gt;<br&gt;Another waiter offered to switch the wet chair for a dry one and asked if there was anything they could do. I said no, there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do but provide a new pair of shorts for my dining partner! 10 minutes later, no dry chair was exchanged with the one made wet. I had to ask for one. <br&gt;<br&gt;The waitress who spilled the water did not come back to our table nor say anything about her mistake. She was laughing and talking with her colleagues.

I came by here on a Sunday afternoon and found the location to be about a 8 minute walk from the Farrer Park MRT station. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was greeted by a glistening showcase of choux pastries. Paralyzed by indecision, I decided on the first item on the menu , a tactic I often use when I am overwhelmed by choices. I devoured the classic vanilla puff, savoring every bite that was filled with crumbly pieces of goodness with a fine balance of cream that was not too sweet. <br&gt;<br&gt;The cafe also has a unique relationship with the Pourover, a coffee vendor that sells, you guessed it, pour overs! I had already had a cup of coffee a few hours prior and had to pass this time around, but hope to return in the future to try the coffee with another cream puff flavor.<br&gt;<br&gt;This is a good place to come with your laptop as the WiFi is strong and the seating abundant - at least until word gets out!"

I look forward to getting my fresh Portabello mushrooms and other yummy treats.  Like they always say &amp;#34; &amp;#34;early bird catches the worm&amp;#34;, do go there early as some of the produces may run out. <br&gt;<br&gt;Usually, we will grab breakfast at its cafe. Great place for family outing with kids.  They have an outdoor trampoline and a play set to entertain the kids.  The only downside to this place is that the parking is limited.

Well, I guess it was thanks to the fortnightly farmers&amp;#39; market that is hosted there by them. Anyway, bf ordered the all day breakfast set - unfortunately they had run out of sausage! Would&amp;#39;ve liked to try it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Anyway, four stars for the breakfast set ($16.50), which included 3 slices of toast (sourdough I think!), mushrooms (would&amp;#39;ve liked to have more!), roasted tomato, extra bacon (since sausage had run out), and scrambled eggs! Everything was actually done really well, except that I might&amp;#39;ve liked some ketchup hmm.. Haha. And in the bf&amp;#39;s words, the bacon was the good quality sort which is kind of ham-like with some fat (as opposed to a lot of fat with little ham).<br&gt;<br&gt;I also decided to have their fruit and nut granola/muesli with greek yogurt and honey ($16.50) on a whim. What kind of granola costs $16.50?! As we were to discover, it was a HUGE bowl. My jaws ached chewing it.. I&amp;#39;m more used to (and definitely prefer) yogurt + granola on top, rather than granola with a smattering of yogurt.  Ratio was certainly not there.. However, the guy at the counter was very nice, provided me with a takeout box when I asked for one (to remove the tons of granola which I was pretty certain I wouldn&amp;#39;t be finishing).<br&gt;<br&gt;Large slices of quiche sat in the display looking pretty inviting, comes with salad and a side (you can pick from the display too - there was a quinoa side that looked pretty gd!). Also, $4.50 scones looked fairly yummy.<br&gt;<br&gt;Nice outdoor seating, the shopfront itself is pretty small so only 4-5 people can squeeze in to order at one go."

It offered the usual CBTL fare, and I had a pretty satisfactory Tuna Sandwich with my Latte -  the latte was alright, nothing spectacular.<br&gt;<br&gt;What I really like about this new CBTL outlet is that they have a cosy ambience and nice decor (cool lamps), varied seating arrangements (sofa, normal height tables, tall tables etc) and best of all, they have a Children&amp;#39;s corner where kids can play in while their parents sip their coffee/tea in peace. <br&gt;<br&gt;I will definitely be back again soon because this is the nearest cafe for me in my vicinity which is so close to the beach.  And, I love the beach! Love going for my evening walks at the beach!"

Sweet, spicy, tangy......how can this humble looking sandwich taste so fabulous? I could not suppress my excitement and wanted to find out what magic has gone into this sandwich. <br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s Chilli flakes that we&amp;#39;ve infused into the olive oil and that tang comes from the clots of lemon milk juice cream you see on top of the mushrooms.&amp;#34; answered the owner Traveen in a slow-paced Norwegian accent. Chilli flakes and lemon milk juice? WOW. <br&gt;<br&gt;This brilliant inspiration can only be found here at Smor, Singapore&amp;#39;s first Scandinavian Deli that is opened by food enthusiast twin brothers Traveen and Tarun Gulrajani. They were so captivated by the concept of Smorrebrod (which means &amp;#34;butter bread&amp;#34;) during their 3-month tour of 12 Scandinavian cities that they decided to bring it to Singapore, elevating to an artisan level with quality ingredients all sources from Scandinavia. <br&gt; <br&gt;It is not only the quality ingredients that make this worth. Like the Kale and Mushroom, the Crunchy Bacon is piled onto buttery and crisp toasted brioche bread that doesn&amp;#39;t turn claggy with the moisture of tomatoes. Topped with side eggs, wilted baby spinach and shavings of emmental cheese, this warm open-faced sandwich is a great breakfast choice that tickles one&amp;#39;s fancy.  <br&gt;<br&gt;These sandwiches worked amazingly better than most cold pleasure-less wraps as they are prepared fresh upon order. The warm versions easily gain the upper hands as our palates acclimatize to the heat but the cold sandwiches are seriously not bad either.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Instead of mundane ingredients like cream cheese and capers, the Smoked Salmon has a lovely acidic-sweet kick coming from the horseradish and dill-infused sweet mustard dressing which I mistaken to be honey at first. <br&gt;<br&gt;Some might find the Norwegian hand-peeled shrimps to be tad salty but if you factor in the tangy lemon mayonnaise and the sprinkles of chives, it&amp;#39;s a simple, refreshing yet addictive combo.  These voluminous seafood filling are stacked onto gluten-free light rye bread is resilient enough to avoid saturation from the extra moisture, yet still soft enough that it doesn&amp;#39;t wear out the muscles as you chow into it.  <br&gt;<br&gt;This is probably also the only place in Singapore where you can discover a fair range of Scandinavian chocolate snacks, savoury produce like caviar or coffee. I bought the Jaffa Nougatine bar ($2.50), some really good milk wafers at only $2.50 and the Shuffle Toffee Biscuits, the sinful combination of snickers, Mars and Toackers that are worth the calories.  I have posted the Shuffle Toffee on my instagram here<br&gt;<br&gt;Was it by chance that we managed to pick all four choices that were delicious? I seriously doubt so. Yes, the price of $6.90 for one sandwich, $12.90 for two and $17.90 for the Viking meal of three might seemed a little pricey or not satisfyingly sufficient for a meal. But trust me, a regular meal of two sandwiches are more than enough to fill you up. Moreover, if it&amp;#39;s such a wholesome meal prepared with healthy ingredients, passion and sincerity, why not?  I seldom say that I will return to try the place but this I shall unabashedly say that a return is a must."

Its rice is cooked in tomato without a hint of seasoning. <br&gt;If you are going to watch a movie after better inform them of your movies timing so they can tell you how long you need to wait for your order or if you need to go to another restaurant.

Oh dear indeed. <br&gt;Having first opened at 313 Somerset, I&amp;#39;ve constantly found myself looking at the menu, without ever being tha roughly impressed by it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Today though, we had the chance to try the Cineleisure branch as they were the few places that were still opened, without being a fast food joint. <br&gt;<br&gt;We decided to share a Charlie Brown Chicken Rice. Described as &amp;#34;Best of Best!&amp;#34; on their menu, the Charlie Brown Chicken Rice will get you gasping &amp;#34;Oh Dear&amp;#34; louder than &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;.<br&gt;<br&gt;If this was their best of best (yes, it&amp;#39;s already wrong grammatically), I would hate to try the rest of their food. <br&gt;<br&gt;According to the description , it&amp;#39;s a Juicy Grilled chicken leg, topped with a sunny side up egg and served with fragrant rice. <br&gt;Now firstly, the egg&amp;#39;s on the rice so it should technically be &amp;#34;Grilled juicy chicken leg served with rice, topped with a sunny side up egg&amp;#34; <br&gt;English aside, if their deciding to change the menu, they could get ride of the Juicy Grilled in the description as well. <br&gt;To describe this Chicken leg as juicy would be like describing Justin Beiber as the best singer / song writer in the world. <br&gt;<br&gt;Here, in front of me, sat a big piece of chicken leg, that was so overcooked, the meat was flakey to the bone. If a piece of breast meat turned out a little dry, fine, it&amp;#39;s a delicate piece of meat, but do they have any idea how long they have to cook a chicken thigh before it dries to the bone? With every cut of the knife, I was hoping it would get better as it reached the bone, but all I saw was flakey dry meat after flakey dry meat. <br&gt;<br&gt;Secondly, the chicken cannot be grilled, seriously. Maybe it was grilled as you prepared for dinner service but upon ordering, it&amp;#39;s clear that it&amp;#39;s been nuked in the microwave and fried in a fryer. I&amp;#39;ve had plenty of grilled chicken in the past, but never have I ever come across a chicken&amp;#39;s skin that crispy, solely from a grill. <br&gt;<br&gt;At $13.80, I could have gone down to KFC and gotten more satisfaction from a 3 piece meal......with change. <br&gt;<br&gt;And the sunny side up egg? It was fried under such intense heat that the base became rubbery and the edges so crispy I could use it in Taohu Telor. <br&gt;<br&gt;Charlie Brown should really start looking into raising the standards of food or this Cineisure Leisure outlet will leave everyone looking at an empty unit going &amp;#34;Oh dear, Charlie Brown&amp;#34;."

What made it were the fries which were twice fried.  The fries retained their crunchiness and taste even after 10 minutes.  A sign of the thoughtfulness of the food.  Only drawback was the price.  Maybe making the dish smaller and less expensive for lunch would be a better way to go.<br&gt;<br&gt;I will definitely return but not too frequently.

The setting and ambience were a nice respite from the usual crowdedness of malls. I like the walk in concept where we get seated by ourselves and order directly at the counter. It&amp;#39;s also easy to help ourselves to the jugs of warm and iced water. The big armchairs were very comfortable. My friend ordered mushroom pasta with cream and cheese while I had a set meal that came with soup of the day and ice cream. My main dish was crabby patty with truffle fries and mango salsa.

A pity that the icing frosting did not melt into a sticky gooey pool. There are plenty of lemon tarts but few is as delicious as the Tangy Lemon Tart ($4.80).

My neighbour told me about their molten lava cake and smores pie, which is then what we ordered. Chocolate overload!<br&gt;<br&gt;The molten lava cake was not as sweet as I expected though, which is good. Still gave me a sugar high (ok perhaps it was the smores pie) but the chocolate quality is detectable to be better than average. With the smores pie, it is a layer of granola crushed bits, with a huge chunk of chocolate, and molten marshmellows. Super decadent. super sweet.<br&gt;<br&gt;The place itself is very whimsical and nice. I really liked the decor, especially the ceiling fairy lights and the adobe walls.

It is perhaps easier to identify their adorably vintage signature car parked outside which is quite hard to miss. I was brought there by a friend who had raved about the place and their waffles.<br&gt;<br&gt;The place was not big but very cosy and comfortable, with quite a nice homely feel to it. We went there in the day but I was told by my friend that it was gorgeous at night with the lights and an open area so I would have to go again to witness it for myself. The staff were extremely pleasant with huge smiles and an ever-ready attitude, which made it a very delightful experience indeed. The happiness of the staff seemed to be rather infectious as it made me feel rather happy too despite the rain outside.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered a chicken baked rice which seemed to be more of an eastern take on chicken baked rice, without the creaminess that most baked rice dishes have. In fact, there was no sauce, and it was simply a slightly sweet chicken and mushroom rice, reminiscent of claypot rice, baked with a layer of cheese that was likely some form of cream cheese instead of the usual cheddar or mozarella. Although it was not the best baked rice I&amp;#39;ve had, it was quite an interesting take on chicken baked rice and went rather well together as a whole. We also had their famous waffles with cinnamon icecream, and though the ice-cream was far too grainy, the waffles were wonderfully fluffy on the outside and crispy on the inside.<br&gt;<br&gt;With the stellar service I received and yummy waffles, I would be more than glad to go back again to verify if it is indeed as lovely as my friend had described at night."

As I live around the area, wimbly lu was probably the closest cafe for me to get a nice cup of coffee and cake. I have heard raving reviews about the place from some friends who have been there a couple of times. My parents were familiar with the area so we found the cafe quite easily. However, I believe it might be pretty difficult for most people to get there by foot as it is located in the private housing estate quite a distance from the nearest MRT station (Serangoon MRT). <br&gt;<br&gt;The cafe is easily identifiable by their signature red car parked outside. The decor of the place is lovely, and great attention is put into the display pieces and ornaments placed around. Walking in, antique looking shelves line the wall, giving the place a touch of vintage. The rustic red bricked wall on one side, coupled with the beautiful lighting gave the place a homely, yet romantic atmosphere. I had their Rootbeer cake, which essentially was a piece of dark chocolate cake infused with root beer, topped with a chocolate root beer syrup and served with vanilla ice-cream. The chocolate cake was alright, and I could taste the hint of root beer with each mouthful. However, the chocolate did not come through sufficiently, which was pretty disappointing as what can be worse in a chocolate cake than not tasting the chocolate. That said, the chocolate syrup was divine. The chocolate was thick, but not too heavy, and the root beer flavour combined with it brilliantly. The vanilla ice-cream was slightly icy, but otherwise went well with the cake. I also had a flat white, which was pretty good!<br&gt;<br&gt;The service at Wimbly Lu was brilliant. The service staff were attentive and patient, answering my questions about their various desserts. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, this cafe is a pretty awesome find and I will definitely be back to try more of their offerings (especially their waffles, which I heard is pretty good)."

No wonder the boy who took my order said the large portion is not big and he could easily finish up the entire thing by himself.  Despite arriving early, the noodles took ages to be served but it was worth the wait. <br&gt;<br&gt;With crispy bits of pork lard on top, the plate was gone within seconds. I did not have enough of it, and peeped over to look at nearby tables to check out the portions. It seemed that one could get more by ordering 3 small size at $6 each rather than 1 large one at $18.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The Stir Bak Choy,  ($10) with crispy whole dried shrimps was not a boring at all. The greens were not loaded with MSG, though it was not very healthy with that golden pork lard that I happily mistook as dried shrimps several times. Not a bad mistake I guess.  <br&gt;<br&gt;But with only 5-6 deep battered prawns at $20, skip this mediocre and overpriced Salad Cream Prawns to save your wallet a hole.<br&gt;<br&gt;Another dish which we would not order again is the Thai Pig Trotters ($22). We could not figure what exactly was very Thai about this except maybe the sauce, which was just plain sweet and nothing else. The meat was tender but the crackling was not as super crunchy as Simpang Bedok&amp;#39;s version.  <br&gt; <br&gt;But the Thai Hot and Sour soup or put it simply Tom Yam soup ($7) was very shiok! (perhaps better than many Thai restaurants). But the use of coconut milk and curry powder inside the soup did not find resonate with Old Ma, who still prefers the one at Seafood International. Well, try it and be your own judge.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The Seafood Beancurd ($14) is napped in a sauce of light brown hue, topped with fish slices, sweet green peas and cuttlefish. The egg tofu encrusted in a brown case was more colorful than plain silky tofu. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Salt-steamed chicken ($12) was very much loved by the elderly. Marinated with chicken wine and steamed with ginger, strips of black fungus and wolfberries, the chicken pieces were not exactly smooth but penetrated with flavours. Not sure if the plate was brimming with collagen or chicken oil, but it must be some good chicken essence.  <br&gt;<br&gt;In short, the food here does not come cheap to me, but some dishes are indeed worth coming back again. Parking is an extreme hassle and avoid coming here on empty stomachs as waiting time might stretch a little. Best dish of the day? Definitely the Chao Da Bee Hoon:)"

The prawn paste chicken was tasty too, as was the hae chor, but the omelette was more greasy than tasty, so that paste longer than most things.

The burnt bee hoon was served rather like a giant omelette, coated with a mix of egg and crispy rice flour coating the vermicelli to give it a delectable crispy flavour. Definitely the restaurant&amp;#39;s signature dish. Also of note was the fish head curry, which, while not overtly spicy, was just the right amount of tantalizing. I did feel, however, that the fish was slightly over cooked, and the dish could do with more sauce (or &amp;#34;zup&amp;#34;), as many love to drench their rice in curry. Our group also ordered a fish soup, prawn paste chicken as well as prawn dish, all of which tasted rather average. Portions were also kind of small for the price we paid (about $12 per pax). <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, it&amp;#39;s worth checking out if you&amp;#39;re in the area or after a long day of IT shopping at the nearby Sim Lim towers.

The aroma was pretty enticing so I tried their mocha muffin. I also got their blueberry cheesecake.<br&gt;<br&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think the long queue is a good representation of the quality of their food. The mocha muffin was mediocre as there wasn&amp;#39;t a good coffee flavour. It sort of just tasted like &amp;#34;rotiboy&amp;#34; coffee buns. The cheesecake was disappointing. The cream cheese had a powdery, slightly dry texture and the base was a vanilla sponge instead of the usual biscuit base. The sponge did not go very well with the cheese and made it taste more like a vanilla cream cake then a cheese cake. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, they do not do great cakes, but for $1+ for a muffin and $3.40 for a slice of cheesecake, I guess you can&amp;#39;t be asking for too much."

Scout out this gem amongst the shady looking bars along Neil road! <br&gt;<br&gt;I love that apiary has many craft flavors and they rotate often. My favorite is definitely black sesame, featured in my post. Not too sweet, just the right amount to end the night. It was pretty funny that the cone was sweeter than black sesame when I tried it another time, so that&amp;#39;s probably not a combi you&amp;#39;d want. Other interesting flavors are uji matcha, blue milk, Ferraro roche. <br&gt;<br&gt;In general, apiary ice cream is the smooth kind. So if you like more texture in your ice cream, they have very few flavors with nuts and crunch added. <br&gt;<br&gt;There are some tables around for you to enjoy your dessert and hang out with friends. Probably enough to fit 15 or so people so it does get a little crowded on weekends. <br&gt;<br&gt;Bring your cash or nets. No credit cards accepted here!"

The decor is Victorian nestled in a  Hoity Toity neighborhood away from the typical Breadtalk group infested malls. If you climb up to the second level, find yourself a corner the bothersome city and time-sensitive to-dos seems to melt away as you sip on your favourite Starbucks beverage (Mine&amp;#39;s Hot Green Tea Latte). <br&gt;<br&gt;Today I met up with a friend here. We chose this place because it was quiet. I could sense there was a lot of weight on his shoulders and he wanted a listening ear. <br&gt;<br&gt;In the bid to forget about my tragic love life, I tend to lose myself to work and slowly drift away from friends. But 2015 seems to have sparked a little something in me at least to be a better friend especially for those who have been there for me through my ups and (lotsa) downs. He is one of them. <br&gt;<br&gt;It has been a couple of months since i last saw him. He looked better physically, in the midst of going through a physical transformation. The geeky muscle type, one that will drive more than a few hearts aflutter. In a way he reminds me of him.<br&gt;<br&gt;He started about how he found love in the past 3 months in an unlikely place. And they have been progressing well getting to know each other better until he found out that this new love of his has a God sister who is overly possessive. She has been making my friend&amp;#39;s life difficult mostly with negative opinions of the relationship as well as cannibalizing his time so the 2 lovebirds can&amp;#39;t meet as much with what little time both of them have.<br&gt;<br&gt;I experienced the emotions that my friend poured out as I slowly sipped on my latte. Indignant at the difficulties he had to fight through and catching the happyness as he describes the lovely things they do together and feeling sorry as he blames himself for the turbulence in his love life.  <br&gt;<br&gt;I wanted to help in a more substantial manner beyond just listening to his relationship woes but realized that there is nothing much I can do beyond giving him a listening ear.

There are ample seats littered all around the cafe, so we had no issues getting chairs and a table. And besides coffee and the usual spread of cakes and sandwiches, this branch also serves entrees like pumpkin soup and pastas too!

This historical breakfast chain started from a single coffee stall in Singapore and has spread across Asia since. I was excited to try some of their kaya  menu items, since kaya (a coconut based paste) originated from Singapore. We ordered some original kaya butter toast and some stuffed kaya egg pieces. Both were delicious! the kaya butter toast was grilled on a charcoal grill, and the butter slice goes along SO well with it (except that it has a million calories and is artery clogging...oh well). The server also flattened the bread so that it was crispy, and cut off all of the crust. Yummy yum with a cup of their legit milk tea.

The casual concept of having a good and cheapish bar with very decent Indian and Western and Asian food clearly works for them -- at one point, I think they have the best burgers in Singapore.

It&amp;#39;s set in a leafy residential neighbourhood near Sixth Ave. Seating is outdoor and non-airconditioned, but you don&amp;#39;t usually need it because there tends to be enough of a breeze to sit outdoors. As you kick back on large wooden tables and chairs you start to realize that this doesn&amp;#39;t really feel very much like Singapore.

The shop occupies a nice large corner space and there are many tables all around the place, so you won&amp;#39;t have to wait very long in the rare event that it&amp;#39;s so crowded you can&amp;#39;t get a seat.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food isn&amp;#39;t mind-blowing but it&amp;#39;s decent for a prata place with the usual prata menu and also a nasi padang counter. The standard of the prata varies with the cook. That means if you come here often and are observant enough, you&amp;#39;ll learn to recognise and know if the cook manning the prata station has got the chops. But it&amp;#39;s never crap so you can be assured of having a satisfying prata. They also do murtabak if you&amp;#39;re really hungry. The fish curry that comes with your curry and murtabak is really good. The different gorengs--maggi, mee, beehoon, kuay tiao--are also decent. And if you want something really substantial, there&amp;#39;s a nasi padang counter<br&gt;<br&gt;But the absolute best thing about Fayidha is this: It&amp;#39;s got the right balance of sleepiness and bustle that makes it a great place to just sit in and chill and daze and watch people doing their thing and the traffic roll by. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s rarely empty but it&amp;#39;s never overcrowded. You might have to stretch a bit to get the attention of the waiters but it&amp;#39;s not infuriating.

I asked for less oil the latest visit this New Year&amp;#39;s Day and all my friends that I&amp;#39;d brought for the first time said the prata was yummy, good crisp and fluffy texture (and not like some places that are crispy but are more like deep fried with overused oil) and looked almost healthy as it had no excess oil! Friends also commented that the fish gravy they serve with was so savoury and nicely balanced with a tinge of the sour. The teh here I keep forgetting is just the right amount of sweetness..I need to remember not to order less sweet next time!<br&gt;<br&gt;Nice touch, all our teh tariks had clearly been genuinely tariked as they had a full layer of froth on.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also had the prata bomb once at  my good friend&amp;#39;s insistence..ok we shared and I really could have eaten one by myself.

So when we came back to SG, we knew we should visit again.<br&gt;<br&gt;Luckily, this outlet near our place satisfies our craving each time. Our favorites are the curry chicken dish (which they say isn&amp;#39;t spicy but trust me, it has a decent kick to it) and the BBQ chicken noodles. I fell in love with chendul in Penang, and they do offer it here, so one day I hope to give it a try.<br&gt;<br&gt;If we&amp;#39;re not in the mood to eat outside or to walk to our favorite hawker, we always end up here.

Note that&amp;#39;s when an already steady flow of customers turns into a longer line waiting to place their orders. I believe this happens around 11pm if I&amp;#39;m not wrong?<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s a decent bingsu but not necessarily worth the markup. It is shaved ice/snow after all. Staff behind the counter take themselves too seriously. We split the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; black sesame bingsu and the injeolmi toast. I found both to be oddly a little dry on the palate. I do appreciate that they&amp;#39;re not too sweet for desserts. Try it if you&amp;#39;re curious and wanting late night sweets but it&amp;#39;s not worth the dedicated run here just to try it."

You will find this 24 hours 7 days a week bingsu shop!<br&gt;<br&gt;They specialise in authentic Korean dessert, mainly Bingsu, and things like toast and even spicy rice cake. You can pick from a variety of Bingsu like Pat Bingsu, Oreo Bingsu, Cheesecake Bingsu, or go for premium bingsu like sesame bingsu, coffee bingsu and strawberry bingsu! The snowflakes bingsus are priced at $14.90 and below, whereas the premium bingsu are priced at $18.90. Though there is no GST or service charge, I still feel that these are premium prices, despite the humble beginings of Nunsongyee at Burghley Drive.<br&gt;<br&gt;The queue for the payment wasn&amp;#39;t too long but the queue for the tables were crazier. The korean lady at the cashier would ask everyone in line if they had a table. If you didn&amp;#39;t have a table, she wouldn&amp;#39;t take your order. There are lots of steps to climb, take note! There&amp;#39;s two floors of dining area, all of which is air conditioned. <br&gt;<br&gt;Nunsongyee doesn&amp;#39;t waste any space on the ground floor, on the ground floor you have a tiny cashier with a menu board and that&amp;#39;s it! So figure out what you want and make payment. You will be handed a buzzer that is rung when your order is ready.<br&gt;<br&gt;Only on the ground floor, you have an al fresco dining setup. On a non-hazy friday cool night, it was perfect. It took us 30 minutes to find a table for 6! Despite them being open for over a month now, the bingsu craze is still on-going!<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Cheesecake Bingsu $14.90<br&gt;Their versions of bingsu are made of milk, thus they do not use the term &amp;#34;shaved ice&amp;#34;. You can immediately taste the milky goodness in your first mouthful. The cheesecake bingsu came in a reasonable portion size. The bingsu was completely covered by the toppings of digestive biscuit crumbs, cheesecake and vanilla ice cream. A small cup of condensed milk came with the bingsu.<br&gt;<br&gt;The ccup of condensed milk made the bingsu have an even stronger milky after-taste. This was something that I could appreciate in comparison to the coffee bingsu which had a bitter after-taste. The ice cream was very smooth and creamy. The cheesecake bits were slightly soury and they were quite dense despite their small cube sizes.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Coffee Bingsu $18.90<br&gt;The coffee bingsu came dressed in almond flakes and a small serving of legit coffee to be poured over the bingsu. The coffee itself wasn&amp;#39;t warm, so it didn&amp;#39;t melt the ice cream or the shaved ice. I liked that we had ordered both a sweet bingsu aka the cheesecake bingsu as well as a bitter bingsu aka the coffee bingsu. Both had contrasting tastes and everyone enjoyed them both!<br&gt;<br&gt;I love the texture of the shaved ice, it&amp;#39;s as smooth as snow!! The portion here is actually the same as the non-premium bingsus. Either ways, each bingsu is meant to be shared with at least 2-3pax.<br&gt;<br&gt;Almost all of of the bingsus here at Nunsongyee come topped with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. Interestingly despite dining outdoors on the ground floor, the ice cream didn&amp;#39;t melt immediately as you would&amp;#39;ve expected. The ice cream lasted quite a while, before getting annihilated  by our spoons.<br&gt;<br&gt;This is like a dream come true for those who have sweet cravings at any hour of the day, or need an alternate late-night hangout place to drinking joints.<br&gt;<br&gt;The prices at Nunsongyee are a bit high especially if you opt for the premium bingsu and add toppings.<br&gt;<br&gt;Besides bingsu, Nunsongyee also offers a menu of Signature Toast ($8.90 to $12.90) and Korean Rice Cake ($6.90 to $8.90), as well as beverages of Coffee, Tea and Smoothies ($3.70 to $6.90)."

The ice here is so finely shaved, and powder-like, doesn&amp;#39;t melt easily, not overly icy, and milky. We got the black sesame bingsu, and the blueberry bingsu. I preferred the black sesame, which came topped with lots of black sesame powder, and red bean paste. The bingsu itself wasn&amp;#39;t very sweet, and you can customize the sweetness with the sweetened milk they provide. <br&gt;<br&gt;The blueberry bingsu had a generous amount of blueberries, painstakingly arranged nicely (guess that&amp;#39;s why they took ages).

Red beans are the traditional topping, but you can choose from other flavors such as &amp;#34;cheescake&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;oreo&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;black sesame&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;injeolmi&amp;#34;, chewy korean rice cake (tteokpokki) coated with shaved bean/peanut powder. With the help of a special machine, the ice is extremely fine and flaky with generous toppings. I generally like the cheesecake and oreo flavors. The quality of shaved ice is rather similar to the ones I&amp;#39;ve had in Atlanta, LA and other Korean-owned establishments in the US. <br&gt;<br&gt;The main thing about this store is that it&amp;#39;s open 24 hours! There are three levels in the building, formerly occupied by Ritz Apple Strudel. The outdoor seating area is on the first floor, and the second floor of the building has a special glass walled room with shaved ice falling to the floor, in case you&amp;#39;d like to have your own snowball fight one degree north of the equator.<br&gt;<br&gt;The only warning that I have to administer, is that your wallet will be taxed S$15-18 for shaved ice. It&amp;#39;s a little pricey considering the local versions of the same dessert cost $2-3 at a food court or hawker center. I guess that&amp;#39;s the cost of the interior decor and that little slice of Korea when you enter the door. I&amp;#39;ll only come here occasionally. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m also wondering how long the K-dessert fad will last. Like the apple strudel before it, it&amp;#39;s won&amp;#39;t be long before Singaporean stomachs move on to the next big thing..."

Koi is where I fell in love with ai-yu, which I can&amp;#39;t get in America, it just doesn&amp;#39;t taste the same. I usually get 0% sugar because the aloe vera and ai-yu have enough sugar to make the tea sweet. <br&gt;<br&gt; I guess Koi is just a very common tea cafe among Singaporeans but it was amazing to me. I&amp;#39;ve tried all the other chained cafes but I always just kept coming back to Koi. <br&gt;<br&gt;I remember during the week before finals at NUS, I probably went to Koi at least 5 out 7 days of the week.

On the lid, there is a sticker which tell you various ways of slurping the tea. I didn&amp;#39;t notice it at first so I stirred my beverage and slurped it. Will try the other two methods next time. I enjoyed the beverage very much. Was expecting it to be thick and milky but it gave a smooth aftertaste. And the pearls (boba) were chewy. Definitely a great addition to the Matcha Milk Tea :)"

However, the mango roll was quite dry in texture, and the passion fruit tea didn&amp;#39;t taste like the described fruit. It tasted fruity and bitter at the same time, which wasn&amp;#39;t pleasant. I drank it all because I paid for it. But, it wasn&amp;#39;t worth the money. We would&amp;#39;ve ordered their savory items. But, the prices for these dishes were even more ridiculously expensive.

Located inside of the Suntec City Mall, you&amp;#39;ll be squealing both internally and externally as you come across the cute storefront and then are led inside where there are Gudetama-adorned booths, egg shell chairs, and a plethora of Gudetama faces all over the walls and even ceiling!<br&gt;<br&gt;The menu consists of basic savory fare - eggs benedict, waffles, fries, salad, a burger, and more - and dessert - cheesecake, chocolate cake, pudding, milkshakes, etc. Each item is somehow Gudetama-themed, whether it be with an actual egg item or a Gudetama face on something else. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Ta-Ma-Go ($17.9 SGD), which were sweet mini cheesecakes deceptively shaped like savory tamago nigiri with a matcha paste (&amp;#34;wasabi&amp;#34;) and syrup (&amp;#34;soy sauce&amp;#34;) on the side. There were 4 cakes and each was topped with a little piece of toasted cake with Gudetama&amp;#39;s face, covered in little rice krispies, and wrapped in a black fondant &amp;#34;seaweed&amp;#34; strip. While it was cute, it wasn&amp;#39;t QUITE as nice as the photo in the menu, and didn&amp;#39;t have a lot of flavor except for the actual cheesecake. The boyfriend ordered the Mooooo Fries ($18.5 SGD), which were sweet potato fries covered with cheese, bulgogi and an egg. It was surprisingly a decent portion and the bite I tasted was pretty good. He finished it and actually felt reasonably full afterwards. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was a bit...below average on our visit. After we requested a few more minutes to peruse the menu before ordering, no one ever came back so we had flag someone down - with much difficulty as the cafe was FAR from busy but none of the employees were looking in our direction. We had to ask for water. It would&amp;#39;ve also been nice to be able to choose where we sat since one of the adorable Gudetama booths was open but we were sat at a regular table instead. We did receive some Gudetama-shaped cookies after paying which was a nice souvenir, though!<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, it&amp;#39;s a fun place to visit for the novelty and to take photos of and with everything, but probably not worth a second visit due to overpriced, decent but average food and subpar service. I did particularly enjoy the complimentary basket of hard boiled eggs - with bright yellow yolks just like eating Gudetama himself!"

I&amp;#39;m a Gudetama fan, however, this place just missed the mark when it came to the food. The presentation would make you think otherwise right? Wrong. First of all, the prices were outrageous. Absolutely shocking actually. The food was not the best quality at all. Not even close. There are SO many things you could make with eggs. I think they could have totally had an amazing menu. So let&amp;#39;s just pretend the little Gudetama faces weren&amp;#39;t on the food... well it tasted like something I wouldn&amp;#39;t even pay $5 for. The breakfast meal had simple fried egg on top of a SOGGY bread. The salad was simple and the beans are 100 percent straight from a can. Nothing about this is special. The pizza was nothing special at all. Let&amp;#39;s just say that appearances in this case are deceiving. The staff was not the most pleasant either. When asked if we could have regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries that one of the dishes is made with, the answer was no. And a blank stare. Literally no sorry or anything. Awkward. And when asked if we can take the paper placemats for keepsake, the answer was also no. I mean, it&amp;#39;s PAPER. <br&gt;The only thing this place is good for like I said, is the novelty of it. I would definitely say this was far from eggcellent. Too bad I got too eggcited. By the way, this is no eggzaggeration. I give it a solid one star."

Portions were very generous as well!<br&gt;<br&gt;Service by their manager was really good. The staff kind of forgot the lasagna so we ended up waiting for a really long time, so she brought us some soup and bread so we wouldn&amp;#39;t starve in the meantime. With that said, the soup had a piece of paper in it, rendering it virtually inedible :/"

Lots of organic stuff and healthy drinks, although cheeseburger is also on the menu.<br&gt;Very contemporary atmosphere, brand new and icy cold aircon, accompanied by (too much) thumping music.
