We sat outside, and they had lots of seating there and inside as well.<br&gt;<br&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t have a huge meal - we shared the spicy Nasi Lemak and the Royale burger. Both were awesome! The Nasi Lemak came with this delicious spicy chili sauce which was amazing, and the rice and egg were perfect. The burger was cooked about medium well (we weren&amp;#39;t asked), and had an awesome spice/herb flavor. Topped with grilled onions, Swiss cheese, and an egg. Fabulous. We only had water to drink, but they had lots of juices, etc. to offer. Check it out! Very fast and pleasant service."

In this case, I was the only sober person in our group. Upon learning Spize was a diner-like chain that existed only in Singapore and served a myriad of local specialties, I crammed everyone into a taxi and off we went.<br&gt;<br&gt;The restaurant is a good size; spacious enough for various groups and just enough breathing room to not feel like it was overly cramped. More importantly, the ventilation was on point. Cold enough to dry our sweat, but not enough to chill our food. Singaporean air con is right up there with the best.<br&gt;<br&gt;After 2AM, it was full of young people who were soaking up their alcohol filled night with all sorts of foods. After a small wait, my group and I were seated and the staff was running around just to fulfill orders. Sadly, it meant that there was a longer wait for us than we wanted. After being passed up several times, we had to flag the waiter down just to get our orders in.<br&gt;<br&gt;Once the food arrived, it was decent, but fairly unmemorable in comparison to the local options I&amp;#39;ve had during my stay. (#1) We had ordered a number of things: nasi goreng ayam, fried beef kway teow, egg + onion roti, along with tall glasses of water. The nasi goreng initially seemed like the winner but it was bland without the hot sauce. The noodles of the kway teow were nice and greasy and the beef was tender enough despite looking overcooked. I want to try other roti combos next time, this one was pretty subpar.<br&gt;<br&gt;It won&amp;#39;t be the last time I&amp;#39;m in Singapore and given my track record, I have a feeling I&amp;#39;ll be back at a Spize location sooner than later. Hopefully I&amp;#39;ll have a better food experience to report.<br&gt;____________<br&gt;<br&gt;(#1) Maybe I just needed to be a tad more drunk. #samelevel"

The decor is also aesthetically pleasing and trendy, with indoor and outdoor seating available.<br&gt;<br&gt;However, the food was nothing to rave about and actually seemed kind of stale, as if it had been sitting out for awhile. Also, the service was very subpar and any request or question was met with a blank stare from the waiters.

No if you truly care about good food and service."

The most extensive range of late night food you could probably ever find, and when you&amp;#39;re tipsy, or tired, or happy, the food will still taste great no matter what. Even sober, the food here doesn&amp;#39;t disappoint, and while it&amp;#39;s no Tony Roma&amp;#39;s or Chilis, but they do offer a great variety of Western and local wares to keep you satisfied.<br&gt;<br&gt;I am a big fan of the fact that they server truffle fries here. Truffle fries! At 3 am in the morning, truffle fries are a godsend. Haha jokes aside, I have seasoned truffle fries connoisseurs tell me that the ones served here aren&amp;#39;t half bad at all. Their food options cover the whole spectrum, from your fish&amp;#39;n chips, to prata, they have almost anything you could think of whilst inebriated. Or sober.<br&gt;<br&gt;Here are a couple of the dishes I have tried which are mention worthy and some you should definitely try when visiting Spize. Their roti john chicken special - cheese, mushroom, chicken goodness on bread. Their maggi goreng seafood pattaya - maggi, with seafood and a tinge of orange spicyness wrapped in a hot omelette, nuff said. Their truffle fries - as mentioned above. Their fish and chips - fried crispy goodness with tonnes of fries. Their bangers and mash - good ol&amp;#39; sausages with creamy mashed potatoes and an equally tasty gravy to match. Their nasi goreng - they&amp;#39;ve got multiple variations of fried rice, be sure to give them all a try. There&amp;#39;s a reason why there&amp;#39;s more than one type. <br&gt;<br&gt;I could go on but you get the jist. I think the magic in this place is that it comes alive late at night, and is always full of sights and sounds way past midnight. Fantastic for eating those post party blues away. Also fantastic for drunk people watching at 4 am in the morning when you are hungry and cannot go to bed. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their only downside, when it gets crowded, be sure to expect that orders will slip through the cracks, and you may end up waiting for some time before those truffle fries finally arrive at your table."

That Mutton pancake thing with the dipping curry is so freaking amazing. To be honest, I have yet to try the other dishes but if it&amp;#39;s anything like that, i&amp;#39;m excited to try more of the dishes. <br&gt;<br&gt;Not much to say about service, just standard.

I am not disputing this. But every place has its own utility and its own niche. Spize covers the &amp;#34;post-clubbing drunk-crowd&amp;#34; niche. And it&amp;#39;s a great niche to cover because, let&amp;#39;s face it, when you&amp;#39;re drunk you could probably pick up a yoghurt-lid slathered in bird shit off the ground and devour it as if it were three-star Michelin fare. Hooray for drunks!<br&gt;<br&gt;I will admit that I&amp;#39;m drunk almost every time I come here. And I come here a lot. It&amp;#39;s basically a ritual. I don&amp;#39;t care that there are other late night options in Singapore, such as Geylang and what have you. What I want late at night after drinking is prata + teh tarik and Spize is the most dependable and easily accessible option. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food is pretty good guys, come on. And you get to be in the company of your fellow drunks and party goers. Always fun! We even get the benefit of fairly dim lighting so that we don&amp;#39;t have to be subjected to the seemingly rapid deterioration of our fellow patrons under harsh fluorescent lighting (exacerbated by our impending sobriety).<br&gt;<br&gt;By the way, even though I order the exact same thing every time I come (cheese egg prata and teh tarik less sweet), I have been very pleasantly surprised by the crayfish.

I only had a day stop over in Singapore and I was so keen to go there. Based on Singapore&amp;#39;s standard, the cat cafe charged quite an expensive price but it was quite understandable because they have to take care of the cat&amp;#39;s litters, vaccination and the exorbitant rent cost. Sam, the owner of the cat cafe, always welcomed us and took his time to chat with us. On our latest visit to the cat cafe, he also gave us the dry food sample for our ragdoll cat, Melody.<br&gt;<br&gt;The cafe was very easy to find and it was a 5-10 walk (depending on how fast you walk) from Clarke Quay Central and One Raffles Place. As you walk to the Level 2 of the 54A Boat Quay, you can see cat paintings on the wall. From time to time, Neko No Niwa sold some limited edition items such as paintings of their cat and painted cotton bags. They also have some cute cat collar and I bought one for souvenir purposes. The best time to visit was in the morning before lunch time or late at night before the cafe&amp;#39;s closing hour.<br&gt;<br&gt;Neko No Niwa adopted all the abandoned cats, gave them loving human touch and let them heal get closer to human by putting them together with the customers. There are some rules that they put in place as a safeguard for both the cats and human patrons (e.g. do not disturb them when they sleep). Every customer who booked for a certain time period will be given a rule book to be read and they can also order some food or drinks from the cafe section. Each drink ordered will arrive with a wooden lid to ensure that the dust / fur didn&amp;#39;t get in it (or maybe so the cat didn&amp;#39;t play around with it). <br&gt;<br&gt;On three occasions I went there with hubby and on the last visit I took my friend (Nevertity) who was really scared of cats. In two hours time, she managed to pet some and even let one slept on her lap (I think it was Jia Jia)! The whole experience was very relaxing and I will definitely go back for another visit when I travel to Singapore. Until then, Neko No Niwa!"

We paid S$12/hour for the first hour each and it seemed steep at first, but the drinks themselves were really reasonably priced and delicious! They had 13 cats when we visited and the menu has a small profile on each of the cats so you can &amp;#39;get to know them&amp;#39;. It was quiet when we arrived and mostly everyone was sleeping, but the cats were extremely friendly. You can pet them to your heart&amp;#39;s content and you can tell they are used to all the attention. <br&gt;<br&gt;The location is absolutely adorable. Located on the 2nd floor above Boat Quay, the cafe has a giant window for the cats to look out and they have a gorgeous view of the Marina Bay Sands. Yes, these cats live a more luxurious lifestyle than even I do. There are plenty of couches to relax on and lots of books and board games if the cats aren&amp;#39;t enough entertainment for you :)<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;d definitely visit again. The atmosphere was relaxing and the workers were incredibly friendly, constantly popping in to dote on the cats and show us things about them. The cafe is also really convenient to the rest of the popular downtown attractions. About a 5 minute walk to Raffles/Long bar for Singapore Slings and then another 15 minutes to the Singapore Flyer/Marina Sands. Not to mention the Boat Quay area that the cafe is located in has TONS of neat looking bars and restaurants. We were at the cafe at 11am, so things were just opening up, but would have loved to spent the evening in Boat Quay along the Singapore River."

Better book a few days in advance if you plan to go there. How it works is that, you have to pay for a cuddling fee of $12/hour/person.

Also will be required to wash hands with soap before going in the cats area. <br&gt;<br&gt;As for drinks, their recommendation is ice chocolate and various teas they have. I don&amp;#39;t usually like chocolate but Since the waiter said it&amp;#39;s not too sweet but slightly on the bitter side ao I gave it a shot and it&amp;#39;s not bad!<br&gt;<br&gt;Oh and they don&amp;#39;t make drinks or food in that place so mostly pre-made.

I was able to call a day ahead for an appointment at 8 PM on a weekday. I only stayed an hour, but I was surprised at the amount of people who came in around 9 PM (especially since they close at 10 PM.) I guess they are right in assuming that the cats would be active around this time.<br&gt;<br&gt;Before you walk in, you will be quickly briefed on the rules and given a small pamphlet with cute pictures and information on all of the cats. <br&gt;<br&gt;The space where all the cats stay is very clean. Their litter is hidden outside and accessible via a small tunnel that runs behind the small coffee/tea bar. They provide various toys you can use to play with the cats, and of course, you are encouraged to pet them (as long as they aren&amp;#39;t sleeping.) Although you&amp;#39;re not allowed to pick up the cats, the workers there can handle them and offer to put them on your lap (only if you want to, of course.) I had the opportunity to have Brown Monkey (the cats have silly names) on my lap, but after a minute she ran away because she wanted to play. :(<br&gt;<br&gt;The $12/hour that you pay goes towards taking care of these cats, all of whom were strays and adopted. I see so many strays around Singapore; it&amp;#39;d be awesome if they could have more of these cafes around the island!"

There were only 4 tables being occupied at that point of time, thus the quiet environment made it even more cosy and relaxing. <br&gt;However upon arriving at our table, I was a little turned off by how dirty their sofa were. Their pastel blue cotton sofas was filled with many obvious dirt and food stain that were left behind by previous customers. Not only did it affects the ambience of the cafe, it also made me question their service and hygiene level.<br&gt;<br&gt;Furthermore, there were very little food available from their (already very little) food selection and it was only 5.30pm, halfway through their operating time. <br&gt;<br&gt;As mention before, the cafe was very quiet thus it&amp;#39;s understandable that they only assign one service staff on duty at that point of time. However, the fact that i have to wait 30mins for a drink and 60mins for my main dish is really ridiculous. The poor service staff (probably new) does not seem to know what he was doing and he could not locate the cook (which resulted in the long wait). The price was rather reasonable but the food was only average, definitely not worth the long wait.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I would recommend this place only if you just want to find a place to chill your time away."

After all , Westin is the only place which offers a seafood afternoon tea. Honestly, I did not know what to expect, I mean I have gone to hundreds of afternoon tea in my life. Never a Seafood Afternoon Tea. <br&gt;<br&gt;Seafood Afternoon Tea starts at 2.30-5pm. We three showed up at 2.25pm. We were standing at the entrance, not a single staff at the bar counter acknowledged us. Not a single staff. We gave each other a look. So strange. Then I stepped in and basically placed myself in front of the two staffs. Only then one of them asked what he could do to help. I told him I had made a reservation for three for the Seafood Afternoon Tea. He checked in the system and confirmed I had a reservation. He led the three of us to a table with couches.<br&gt;<br&gt;FOOD 5/5<br&gt;The seafood tower took a while to be brought to our table. We were like where was the food? The staff did not tell us perhaps it would take a while for them to prepare? Then again I was not expecting it took a whole 20+ mins for the food to be served since we had a reservation. <br&gt;<br&gt;However, once the seafood tower was served, the flow of the other courses went a lot smoother. <br&gt;<br&gt;The lobster roll and the crab tartare on Melba toast (from the seafood tower) were absolutely delicious.<br&gt;<br&gt;The lobster thermidor itself plus the wonderful plate of dessert totally worth the $45++ price tag. <br&gt;<br&gt;AMBIENCE 5/5<br&gt;The stunning view of the marina &amp;amp; surroundings, plus the calmness at the lobby lounge easily earned a 5 stars from me. The lobby lounge was also well- designed.<br&gt;<br&gt;SERVICE 3/5<br&gt;What&amp;#39;s with the seafood tower? The food items were not presented well. Clearly the staff in charge of plating was clueless. Try this.. place all the food items on the three plates of that tower, fill up every plate as evenly as possible and make sure the tower looks aesthetically pleasing. <br&gt;<br&gt;The whole service was just underwhelming. Like my brother said, the staffs were like &amp;#34;amateurs&amp;#34;. They were not rude but needed better training. I guess we expected more from a Westin. There is definitely lots of room to be improved in this department. <br&gt;<br&gt;Based on food and ambience, I would totally return for another round of Seafood Afternoon Tea at Westin. <br&gt;<br&gt;Note: The gold status I have with BonVoy got me a 15% discount :D"

The panoramic view over the city, port and ocean is extremely memorable. The seating is comfortable: about 80% of the seating is by the windows in very comfortable and plush seating. The service, which is usually any venue in Singapore&amp;#39;s biggest liability, is spectacular here. Not only are we talking about the usual &amp;#34;yes sir&amp;#34;, but eager servers who are on the constant lookout for any slight gesture to approach the table (a slight nod will be indicative enough, no need to wave your hands continually in the air as I&amp;#39;ve found myself having to do way too often at other venues) and are quick to get your order in. The coffee is served in an exquisite glass china set, in which layered coffee drinks show their true art (think cappuccinos), and to top it off, usually a small dessert is served alongside. Prices are pretty reasonable per se for a venue as such, but the added bonus is that Starwoods Preferred Guests (their loyalty program) members are eligible for a 25% discount on their bill regardless of whether they&amp;#39;re actually staying in the hotel or not. Glasses of wines and beers are also quite reasonable for those looking to kick a few back after a long day. Remember this is the W hotel, so be ready to come across an extremely posh and cosmopolitan crowd."

If you order the set, hey serve this with two large runny eggs. If you do not like runny eggs, like me, you can either leave them aside or give it a try! I mixed them together and added a bit of vinegar and soy sauce hat was on the table and gave a a stir, then dipped the bread slices in it. We ordered the regular butter and the peanut butter toast and can&amp;#39;t complain about either.<br&gt;<br&gt;The matcha frostyz was very good! It tasted like a Starbucks frappe but matcha flavored, I would order it again if I could. Honestly, if they had this place in the states I would go all the time because it is a simple concept of something that everybody loves, made in a fast food version!"

All on an onion bagel. It was easily was of the messiest bagels I&amp;#39;ve ever eaten, but also one of the best (comparable to the one I&amp;#39;ve had in New York). Just everything was perfect. The onion bagel was crispy and just the perfect amount of onion, the spam, chutney, etc. combination was really great and tasty. Everything tasted fresh, which is weird to say about spam, but you know, everything else tasted fresh. I was kind of sad my bagel was over. I know I mentioned their menu was interesting but I definitely feel it warrants another mention: I haven&amp;#39;t gone to a bagel place with such a wide offering - it&amp;#39;s usually pretty boring, typical stuff, but Two Men Bagel House offers so much more (I mean, corn chowder soup bagel? Like what even? Give me some of that!! And who the hell doesn&amp;#39;t want to eat something called Hot Mess?). I legit wish I had more time to stick around and try something else!<br&gt;<br&gt;I almost forgot to say: though you order up front and then grab a seat, the staff at the counter were hilarious as well, cracking jokes with us - really great service and made for a good atmosphere."

I picked a time slot that I could receive a 50% discount off food at the Long Black Café, aka 630pm on a Friday night. Take note the discount does no work on drinks and for this outlet, the discount does not apply to desserts either.<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Truffle Fries $5.90+<br&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at the portion of truffle fries at this price point! That&amp;#39;s a lot of freshly fried potato with a strong and distinctive aroma of truffle oil. As the dining area is alfresco, the truffle fragrance does dissipate pretty quickly. Nonetheless, a great starter!<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Spicy Tabasco Wings $5.90+<br&gt;Shiny with Tabasco sauce evenly smoothened over the winglets, these wings were said to be HAWT! And yummy at the same time.<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Sauteed Mushrooms $5.90+ *highly recommended*<br&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting much when I ordered this but oh boy~! are these great tasting sautéed mushrooms. I almost wanted to order another server of this. These were so juicy, with the characteristic earthly flavour. Mildly salty with a tinge of cheese fragrance.<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Calamari Rings $5.90+<br&gt;You get about 8 pieces of Calamari ring but at half-off, $3+, that&amp;#39;s not too bad, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t pay full price for this side. Nothing fantastic but also nothing bad about this.<br&gt;<br&gt;5. The Long Black Special Beef Burger $12.90+<br&gt;That&amp;#39;s one juicy looking beef patty and the buns looked so crisp but sadly they were soggy and bland. The beef tasted reasonably good along with their crisp fries. You can also swap the fries to a salad, to be on the lighter side.<br&gt;<br&gt;6. Salmon Baked Rice $10.90+<br&gt;It took another 10-15 minutes, after we were served this, to cool down the dish before I could consume it without scalding my tongue. There was a lot of cheese, some salmon and lots of mushrooms. YAY! But sadly the rice didn&amp;#39;t take in the flavour from the ingredients and it was more like creamy rice with a side of cheese.<br&gt;<br&gt;7. Chicken Baked Rice $9.90+<br&gt;The chicken baked rice tasted better than the salmon baked rice, as the rice always soaked up the chicken goodness. I would go for this again if I were to dine here at the Long Black again.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall :  A nice place to dine and hang out, but do remember it&amp;#39;s alfresco dining, and you are at the mercy of the stand fans. Go for their chicken baked rice and sautéed mushrooms. I didn&amp;#39;t get a chance to try their coffee but it sure looks like a good cuppa!"

I especially adore the Dark chocolate Mooncake (above) as the intensity of the cacao accentuates the sweet dash of caramel. Somehow, the image of an elegant, miniature version of Pierre Herme&amp;#39;s Plasir Sucre surfaced in my mind as I savour them slowly. <br&gt;<br&gt;The White Chocolate with Champagne Ganache and Strawberry Pearl was too sweet for my liking and the taste of champagne was overshadowed by the sweetness of the strawberry compote. However, the quality of the chocolate consistently shines here just like the rest of the chocolate mooncakes, with an alluring smooth and shiny texture. In fact, few might know that Laurent adopts environmental-friendly practices and works with Alain Abel, the founder of Tahiti Vanille for the best quality vanilla for his products.<br&gt;<br&gt;Last but not least, Japanese Green Tea Mooncake was highly enjoyable as there was a surprise crunch from the black sesame seeds that was blended into the green tea chocolate. In addition, the zesty passion fruit compote provided a desirable switch of taste. <br&gt;<br&gt;Each of these chocolate mooncakes  are also available at individual piece for $12. Though these up-sized chocolate pralines might not be traditional, they are still delectable sweet treats that definitely go well with a cup of tea to enjoy during the Mooncake festival. And they probably save you some calories accumulated this season."

You&amp;#39;ll think it&amp;#39;ll be too sweet but the cold vanilla with hot soufflet neutralise each other and the taste is heaven. <br&gt;<br&gt;The down side? Having to wait 30 minutes for it to be made on the spot. So if you are having dinner next door, come by and order it in advance and they will call you when it&amp;#39;s ready.

The cake options also look visually veryyy yummmmy. Ordered a slice of cake and the Raspberry Sorbet - which was really quite good. I loved the Sorbet. The decor looked pretty cool - decked with Moet bottled on top and boxes designed pretty nicely - with their logo. They serve you water as you sit - and the store as a whole looked nice. I like that they have ice-cream and chocolate cakes. It&amp;#39;s good to have a balance of fruity and chocolate.<br&gt;<br&gt;What I Didn&amp;#39;t Love: The cake slice, the Equator, was pretty hmmmm. I&amp;#39;ve tasted better elsewhere.

If we&amp;#39;d known this, we probably would have spread out the mint a bit more! The chocolate sauce was so good I ate it on its own and then felt like a pig. <br&gt;<br&gt;3. Venezuela hot chocolate: Was really good. The thickness was creamy and satisfying, not one of those watery versions you get elsewhere. Flavour was also strong and even. <br&gt;<br&gt;4. Ginger lemonade: This had actual ginger slices in the lemonade, though the ginger taste wasn&amp;#39;t extremely strong. Refreshing after all that chocolate."

I liked that the barista checked with me if I wanted my hot chocolate less sweet or anything. Appreciated the thought. Coffee at jewel is always reliable. You get 20 cents off if you bring your own mug. Mine says jewel coffee on it not sure if that makes  a difference. They could offer a little more discount like 30 to 50 cents for that?<br&gt;<br&gt;Previously I had a takeaway Gibraltar here. You get to choose your beans usually out of 2 options here. But I was a little disappointing they didn&amp;#39;t steam the milk well and take the effort to do even simple latte art. Jewel charges a bit more for coffee than others and the texture or the milk does add to the enjoyment.

It offered Local Lunch Semi Buffet (S$45++) with a choice of main and free flow of selected drinks, as well as, Local 3-tier After Tea (S$30++).<br&gt;<br&gt;For the 6 of us, we were showed to a table with 2 comfy sofas. <br&gt;<br&gt;The choices for the main are : Bak Chor Mee, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Katong Laksa, Prawn Noodle Soup, Fish Bee Hoon Soup, Chili Crab and Mantou. We selected all except for the laksa.<br&gt;<br&gt;Fish Bee Hoon Soup 鲜鱼米粉汤 (S$24++)<br&gt;The key ingredient in this dish is the giant snakehead. Here the restaurant used Hamachi made in the traditional way, where deep-fried fish bones are put on a rolling boil for hours to form the soup base. A touch of X.O. brandy is added to elevate the hearty and milky broth without any evaported milk - an original recipe by Ka Soh Restaurant.<br&gt;It was my favourite. The soup was rich and creamy, full of flavours. It was served with deep fried pork lards by the side.<br&gt;<br&gt;Prawn Noodle Soup 虾面汤 ($26++)<br&gt;Mr Lee Pi Duan arrived from Nan&amp;#39;an (Fujian Province) in 1928 and started selling prawn noodles without knowing that one day his family will run nearly all the most popular noodle shops in Singapore. The version here closely resembles the Beach Road Prawn Mee version, run by Lee&amp;#39;s eldest son, John.<br&gt;The Prawn Noodle Soup was served with chilli powder by the side. The soup was rich and flavourful, topped with huge pieces of prawns, plus lots of crispy deep fried pork lards in it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Bak Chor Mee 肉脞面 (S$24++)<br&gt;A luxurious take on Bak Chor Mee, this noodle dish takes its recipe from the signature fish maw soup at Seng Kee Mushroom Minced Meat Noodle. The umami soup broth is brewed from pork bones and dried sole, chock-full of quality threadfin fish maw, minced pork, pork slices, egg and topped with stewed mushroom slices.<br&gt;Not the usual kind. The soup was flavourful with lots of liao. Best had the soup while it still warm. The taste could be pretty fishy when cold. The noodle itself was a bit of a let down.<br&gt;<br&gt;Hainanese Chicken Rice 海南鸡饭 ($20++)<br&gt;Singapore is the chicken rice capital of the world. Our inspiration for this traditional Hainanese dish is the old-school style of Chef Yong Jia with tender poached chicken. The fragrant rice is cooked in flavoursome chicken stock and spices, and eaten with a piquant garlic chilli sauce.<br&gt;The chicken was deboned and tender. Personally I like pairing the chicken with the garlic sauce that served with it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chilli Crab and Mantou 辣椒螃蟹和馒头 ($26++)<br&gt;Chilli crabs had humble beginnings at a pushcart along East Coast Road in 1956. Later on, Chef Hooi of Dragon Phoenix Restaurant added sambal and eggs to enrich the gravy, leading to this version of chilli crabs topped with X.O. sauce for an extra kick which we all enjoy today.<br&gt;The crab had most of its shell removed and easy to handle. The gravy was pretty spicy and went quite well with the crispy mantou that served with it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Besides the mains, the buffet included a selection of local appetisers and desserts. <br&gt;From the dessert table, it served a selection of popular local nyonya kueh in traditional HarriAnns Peranakan style, such as Ondeh Ondeh, Kueh Rainbow lapis, Ang Ku Kueh Mung Bean, Kueh Keledik, Kueh Bugis, Kueh Sago Melaka, Kueh Pink Fairy, Peanut Ang Ku Kueh, Kueh Dadar, Kueh Salat, and Kueh Lavander. My favourite was the Ang Kue Kueh which was pretty small and delicate in texture with very thin skin.<br&gt;<br&gt;Bubur Pulut Hitam 黑糯米粥 (S$16++)<br&gt;Black Glutinous Rice Dessert<br&gt;Sweetened black glutinous rice porridge inspired by HarriAnns, drizzled with coconut milk and served warm. <br&gt;The texture was smooth and creamy without too sweet.<br&gt;<br&gt;Bubur Cha Cha <br&gt;The version here was served hot with the soup in a bright pink. It was not too sweet with soft melt in the mouth pieces of sweet potato and chewy bits.<br&gt;<br&gt;There was also live station at the small stretch of buffet counter. Spring roll and Kueh Pie Tee were freshly made on the spot by the chef. The spring roll was firm while packing lots of liaos inside."

The station looked small, but the spread of seafood available was good enough to rival the usual big named buffet restaurants, with raw oysters, clams, mussels, prawns, crabs, and the uncommonly found mini lobster 小龙虾.<br&gt;<br&gt;Besides this, there was live stations for craving of roast beef, slicing of sashimi, cooking of pasta with 3 type of sauces available, and noodle of the day which was Mee Rebus for that day. <br&gt;<br&gt;The static stations offered a wide spread too. From assorted salads, to assorted soups, to assorted cheese, to assorted breads and breadsticks, to assorted dim sum, to assorted sushi and maki, to Indian cuisine spread (the restaurant had 2 Indian chefs), to Chinese cuisine spread, to other International cuisine spread. But the one that caught my attraction the most was the dessert spread, which had chocolate fondue, ice cream in cups, assorted cakes, assorted biscuits and Durian Pengat with condiments such as coconut milk, gula melaka syrup, green chendol jelly, sweet corn and red bean. Best get the Durian Pengat as soon as possible which ran out very fast but was replenished soon after."

Since I ordered 2 brunch items, I had as Cappuccino ($5.50) and Latte ($5.50) as the free drinks. Could not taste the different between the both drinks as both are quite milky."

With its refreshed food and beverage menu at its Pan Pacific outlet, there are now more choices for my picking!<br&gt;<br&gt;All day breakfast FTW! I really liked the Humble Baked Egg Skillet ($16), which is a hearty mix of tender and flavorful roasted lamb stew with sweet potatoes, sous vide eggs and Emmental cheese to add on that creamy and stringy texture. They really ought to serve bread with this massive pan. I highly recommend that you have this to share because it&amp;#39;s really quite a huge portion. While i don&amp;#39;t see myself having this at 8am in the morning, this is certainly perfect for brunch, or dinner.<br&gt;<br&gt;The other new all day breakfast dish is the Jumbo Breakfast Burrito ($16). On paper, it sounds perfect with the Spanish chorizo, scrambled eggs, chipotle puree and smoked cheddar. However in reality, the filling tasted more like an Asian fried omelette. With a burrito, you gotta go big or go home and this was kinda lacking in the flavor department. The guacamole looked a little too liquified (and packaged) for my liking.<br&gt;<br&gt;I enjoyed the Fish Tacos ($20), which had generous pieces of battered snapper paired with avocado and mango salsa, chipotle aioli, and red cabbage slaw. That chipotle sauce had a tinge of curry to it strangely but it really pulled the dish together. Would love for a crispier batter but this will do. For the non-carb version, go for the Fish n Chips, which uses the same battered fish.<br&gt;<br&gt;I never understood well done meats so i absolutely do not get the Country Fried Steak ($22), which looked like a crispy chicken fillet when it was served. Well well... 100-day dry aged beef or not, this was dry, grainy and powdery, which is not what dry aged is btw. Poor cow died in vain..<br&gt;<br&gt;The same situation repeated with the Espresso Rubbed Rack of Lamb ($32). I was desperately searching for the pink bits but I failed. Another Australian grass-fed lamb that died in vain. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind having this bittersweet dish if the meat were medium rare and there&amp;#39;s more of the buttery and savory carrot puree. <br&gt;<br&gt;Oriole Coffee Cake ($14) was my super love. This is a coffee-textured chiffon cake infused with Oriole&amp;#39;s signature house blend coffee. It looked super dry but looks can be so deceiving! This chiffon was super light, fluffy and slightly moist too. Don&amp;#39;t go expecting a flowing espresso crème anglaise core though, it&amp;#39;s really NOT a lava cake. That said, that espresso sauce was so damn rich and velvety good. LOVE. And HELLO espresso jelly.<br&gt;<br&gt;Another hit on the list is the Death Cream ($9). This be the death of all hard core yoga sessions but the deliciousness is worth all that calories. Super concoction of vanilla beans, espresso and cream, which came out of a popular 1980s secret coffee recipe. Think of it as a melted coffee ice cream with lots of vanilla bean specks. So DAYUMS good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Another new drink is the Haute Chocolate ($8), made from single-origin Valrhona Chocolate (66% Cocoa). It has a tinge of sourness which is characteristic of raw cacao. I thought the cold version was quite watered down at the start, but as it warms up, you get more of the flavor. I reckon the hot version should be more intense. You could have this with milk as well.<br&gt;<br&gt;So another feature at the flagship outlet at the Somerset outfit is the Tasting Bar, where you can learn more about the coffee.  <br&gt;<br&gt;New options featuring Single Origin Coffee, Kamiro Lot #103 and Buesaco Microlot #1, will also be available. If your date enjoys coffee, this is the place to head to. <br&gt;<br&gt;For all the other times that you need a quick perk me up or grab and go, Oriole&amp;#39;s takeaway counter will set you up with some pastries or cakes for $5 a pop. I&amp;#39;d definitely grab one of those Pistachio Cake, or Red Velvet cupcake with coconut cream cheese frosting! Along with the Death Cream of course!<br&gt;<br&gt;So Oriole Coffee + Bar is back and better. Something needs to be done about their service still (it has always been a problem), but i may ignore that for a bit, as long as i have my Death Cream."

I have been walking past this place for some time now, and finally decided to give it a try.<br&gt;<br&gt;Its a cafe+restaurant+bar with outdoor and indoor seating. I love the rustic decor. It seems good for group gatherings, business meetings, etc. The service was mediocre, it was hard getting the waiters attention. At one point I just got up myself and got salt off the shelf. This place is more on the expensive side, but then again it is comparable to every other restaurant in the area. What isn&amp;#39;t expensive in Singapore? <br&gt;<br&gt;Anyways, lets get to the food.<br&gt;<br&gt;For appetizer, we ordered the Spinach Truffle Salad with a poached egg. This was pretty good. The only downside is that they shave in the truffle on top, so you really don&amp;#39;t taste it unless you get a piece of the truffle in your bite. <br&gt;<br&gt;Entrees, we got the:<br&gt;<br&gt;Truffle Burger - The burger itself was pretty good and it definitely hit the spot. Although, it could be because I haven&amp;#39;t had a burger in a long while. The down side again was that they only shaved two slices of truffle on top of the cheese, which you really couldn&amp;#39;t taste it at all. I would&amp;#39;ve added truffle oil to the cheese to give it that truffle taste. (As you can see I&amp;#39;m a huge truffle fan) For $18, I wouldn&amp;#39;t say this burger is worth the price. <br&gt;<br&gt;Beef Cheek Tagliatelle - We ordered this because we saw that this dish was pretty popular on yelp. The beef cheeks were delicious but we wasn&amp;#39;t a fan of the sauce, it was lacking in salt. It also could&amp;#39;ve used some Parmesan.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally for dessert, we ordered the sticky date puddling. I have to say it was pretty damn good! You have a date cake, drizzled (ok more than drizzled) with caramel on one side and ice cream on the other. Together it was just amazing. Highly recommended! (edit: I thought I took a picture of this, but I guess the second it landed on our table we devoured it :))<br&gt;<br&gt;Food was alright, but we would definitely come back for the dessert and some drinks!"

Service is also very much hit and miss but my local friends have told me my expectations of service will not be met in Singapore. Still if you are on Orchard road this is a good place to go."

Unlike my last review, where the burger cost $20++ and didn&amp;#39;t include fries, the Cuban sandwich I ordered was huge AND came with fries and a small salad... for a little under $20. Pretty good deal for Singapore! My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach, and I could only finish half of the sandwich.

Accordingly, it&amp;#39;s adapted by offering some of the highest prices for coffee in Singapore, and remodelling the interior to make it less friendly to overstayers and encourage throughput. <br&gt;<br&gt;The coffee is excellent. Oriole was one of the earlier players in the hipster coffee craze and at least on that end, they deliver. This is a light to medium roast with aromatic Latin American or African single origins. But the bill will hurt. It is only the excellence of the coffee that gets them 4 stars, and the excuse that the location favours Starbucks over hipster craft coffee artisans.<br&gt;<br&gt;It used to be a bunch of tables serving food as well as coffee, but the new interior consists of wide open spaces and large wooden steps on which people slouch uncomfortably. I can&amp;#39;t help but wonder if this is on purpose. Old Oriole was hard to get a seat in. New Oriole isn&amp;#39;t bad, just... dehumanized?"

It&amp;#39;s also one cafe that I go back to on a regular basis. Starting with a flagship cafe, bar and restaurant in 313 Somerset, Oriole has expended to include a new roastery in Chinatown (Jiak Chuan road) and a cafe in Republic Plaza.<br&gt;<br&gt;Espresso - golden brown crema, consistent with coffee beans which have been roasted recently - exactly what I would expect from an established coffee roastery. The initial impression was of citrusy and berry-like flavours, which were neither too tart nor astringent. This was complemented by a slightly viscous, syrupy mouthfeel, and the correct volume for an espresso shot. Each of the elements of a good shot were there, combining to create a shot that was so much more than a combination of ground beans and steam. <br&gt;<br&gt;There are also some interesting combinations of caffeine and milk happening above Somerset station. The espresso shot mentioned above was paired with silky smooth microbubbles, resulting in a balanced drink, but a cappuccino which retained it&amp;#39;s potency. The aftertaste lingered, with sweetness evident in the foam - this occurs when milk is steamed at the correct temperature, increasing the solubility of the lactose. Unlike a lot of cafes, I could also taste the citrus notes in the milk, a nice touch that I don&amp;#39;t always see. <br&gt;<br&gt;Piccolo lattes are also a speciality in Oriole. The piccolo that I tried was beautiful - built upon a foundation of a double ristretto, with potency tempered by smooth foam. Ristretto on the menu is always a good sign - think of it as an even more intense espresso, consisting of the first 10 seconds of extraction, unlike a regular espresso shot which extracts for 18 - 30 seconds. For coffee lovers, the presence of ristretto on the menu is a subtle indication that the level of coffee knowledge on the part of the staff is higher than average - it suggests an understanding of the effect of different extraction times for a shot."

In LIC&amp;#39;s review, the Beef Cheek and fish &amp;amp; chips were priced at $15 and now they are $22 &amp;amp; $19 respectively (excluding service charge &amp;amp; GST - an additionally 17%). I am not sure the reason for the price hike given that the portions &amp;amp; ambiance looks the same. With 313 opening up beside it, all the more foot traffic and more restaurants to compete with... so why the need for the steep increase? The only fathomable reason I could think of is that their rent went up. Regardless, I think it&amp;#39;s daylight robbery to inflate one&amp;#39;s prices by 50% within such a short period of time. <br&gt;<br&gt;1. Beef Cheek Tagliatelle $22 -  (red wine &amp;amp; citrus braised beef cheek, mushroom, shallot oil). The beef cheeks were soft and tender. Pasta &amp;amp; the sauce was ok. Nothing fantastic. I would give this dish a 3/5. <br&gt;<br&gt;2. Jamaican jerk chicken $22 - (grilled jerk-rub baby chicken, corn salsa, crispy onion rings) - This dish was very dry. My friend had to request for chili sauce to go along with this dish. They chose to use chicken breast which can be awfully tasteless and dry when not prepared well. Most of the Jamaican jerk seasoning was only on the surface of the chicken&amp;#39;s skin (sprinkled like salt &amp;amp; pepper) and leaving the meat rather tasteless after you dig into it. <br&gt;<br&gt;3. Apple strudel (traditional bavarian, phyllo-wrapped apple-raisin strudel, warm vanilla sauce , top up $4 for a scoop of vanilla-bean ice cream)  - Good. The apple strudel came baked like a pie in a pan. It was pippin&amp;#39; hot went well with the scoop of ice-cream at the side. <br&gt;<br&gt;4. Philly steak &amp;amp; cheese  (beef striploin, onions, peppers, swiss cheese, baguette) - Average. Looks like a sandwich (with buns).      <br&gt;<br&gt;5. Citrus sin  (double ristretto, spiced orange juice, steamed milk) - Good. Interesting zesty taste to the coffee. It&amp;#39;s one of their award-winning coffees. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service - ok <br&gt;<br&gt;Ambiance - rather dim &amp;amp; romanic. Pretty good for date nights but can get annoying if you like to take pictures of your food like I do (to post on Yelp). <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I think I would return for the coffee only. Food is overpriced for the an average quality."

And by grandfather, I mean the one that sits in an armchair with trousers up to his armpits demanding that one of his grandchildren fetches his slippers.<br&gt;<br&gt;Let me explain. To counter all these recycled wood and faux-industrial whipper snappers, Oriole still looks like it&amp;#39;s stuck in the early 2000s. Even its menu is an unashamed mish-mash of random pastas and sandwiches. No trendy avocado mashes or pork cheek brioche burger benedicts here! Just good old Philly cheese steak and... potato wedges. Remember potato wedges? They can probably still be found on the menu of your local Harry&amp;#39;s-style after-work watering hole. And at Oriole.<br&gt;<br&gt;So that accounts for grandpa&amp;#39;s unfashionable attire. Oriole has been there long enough (and has real-estate on Orchard prime-enough - comfortable armchair) to not care. And the coffee is still pretty good, it certainly cuts it better than some of these upstarts. None of the baristas have waxed mustaches or clubmaster glasses, nor do they wear the latest chambray shirts, but they are working with locally roasted coffee, not inferior Genovese.<br&gt;<br&gt;So these  grandkids of Oriole should not only fetch the slippers but kneel down and kiss the ring. Maybe Palheta roasts better and maybe Common Man is more popular with the couples brunch crowd. But Oriole blazed this trail long before and was grinding &amp;amp; steaming while they were still nappy-clad dreams in their owners&amp;#39; minds. Respect it."

Firstly, when taking the order, his attention was anywhere but on taking the order. As expected, he got the order wrong. We ordered a chicken alfredo and requested for it to be spicy. When it came, it was an aglio olio with chicken. I called him over and told him that we did not order an aglio olio but instead a chicken alfredo. He insisted that it was an alfredo. No cream and looked exactly like an aglio olio. This man must take me for a fool. After awhile of back and forth, he finally came up with an excuse that the chicken alfredo cant be made spicy so he just conveniently decided to give us an aglio olio instead and left. Called the manager over and told him we got the wrong order. The manager took the plate away and talked to the server who then came over and said he will give us an alfredo with chilli on the side. That was perfectly fine. I just dont appreciate lying just to cover your blunder. Towards the end of the dinner, the same server wrongly tried to give us the credit cards of other customers who have made payment. TWICE. I dont know what is going on with this service staff but I hope the management will look into this."

It also gets really noisy on weekends - to the point that I had difficulty listening to my girlfriends speak. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food wise, I had the Fish and Chips which, to be honest, wasn&amp;#39;t fantastic. The portion was quite generous, but the fish felt too oily, while the fries (which were more like wedges) were excellently done. Other dishes that were ordered were the Jerk chicken ,which was quite flavourless, and the Bangers and Mash, which was the exact opposite. The prices were pretty steep, however, with just the food dishes averaging to about $20-$30 per person. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now to the coffee, which I came for. I ordered the picolo latte, while my girlfriends ordered a flat white and Citrus Sin (their competition coffee). I took a bit of each, and while their flat white was far from exceptional, their picolo latte was very, very well done. The citrus sin was also very unique (though it wasn&amp;#39;t to a friend&amp;#39;s liking)<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, a place worth hanging out if you&amp;#39;re looking for a girls&amp;#39; night out with coffee lovers.

Head Barista and Assistant Manager is John Ting, who came in 2nd at the Singapore National Barista Championship. That&amp;#39;s right, Oriole has the two best baristas in Singapore, and it shows! If I were still living in Singapore, I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that this would be my favourite coffee hang-out. In fact, I&amp;#39;ve been here three times in two weeks.<br&gt;<br&gt; Coffee prices here are just a little more expensive than the chains before factoring in service charge, but it&amp;#39;s well worth the extra money. The staff pick their coffee with care, as Ï witnessed when I swung by yesterday, with a helpful chap talking me through the beans they used when I wandered over to the giant coffee roaster (named Ella, so I&amp;#39;ve read). He also mentioned that they were expecting some really nice coffees in a couple of days time so I should return. I will definitely do that, even though I don&amp;#39;t own an espresso machine (yet) and only have a Bialetti.<br&gt;<br&gt; The best drinks to have here are the piccolo latte (comes with two shots), the chilii chocolate mocha and the citrus sin! The last two are drinks created by Keith for the World Barista Championship, and both were really nice indeed. For the chili chocolate mocha, I couldn&amp;#39;t taste too much of the coffee, but it wasn&amp;#39;t overwhelmingly chocolate-y either. It was a tad smokey (which I liked) and the flavour of the chili got stronger as I drank more of the beverage, but not enough to kill this chili weakling. As for the citrus sin, it was absolutely fantastic. It comes with a slice of orange so that you can squeeze the juice of it if the drink isn&amp;#39;t citrus-y enough for you. I didn&amp;#39;t taste very much of the citrus, but it was very smooth, and by far one of the most delicious coffees I&amp;#39;ve ever had. Two thumbs up!<br&gt;<br&gt; The latte art has been of a generally high standard, and I was only disappointed once, when my friend&amp;#39;s piccolo latte came with three somewhat splotchy white patches. Possibly, they could have been three separate flowers, but, to me, they looked... messy.<br&gt;<br&gt; But enough about the coffee. What about the rest?<br&gt;<br&gt; The food was so-so, to be honest. I have had a set lunch consisting of crab and corn soup and a spaghetti bolognese, and a prawn aglio olio. All the dishes were decent, nothing much to complain about, or shout about.<br&gt;<br&gt; The cafe is very cosy. It&amp;#39;s fairly dark in here, and tables are generally well-spaced so you never feel as if you&amp;#39;re being crowded even when the place is full. I like the lighting fixtures for some reason. Very modern without being too showy. The ceiling with the exposed piping toughens the place up a little so it doesn&amp;#39;t look pretentious.<br&gt;<br&gt; So, if you haven&amp;#39;t already been able to tell, I love this place. I will do my best to return before I go back to London, even though I have several other coffee places on my list to check out. And given its late opening hours, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll be too hard for me to do so!"

The Lindemans beers were sweet but tasted better than the Wittekerke in my opinion. We also had a carafe of Berries Daiquiri for $38 which was actually really good. What I didn&amp;#39;t like so much were their desserts. We ordered an Eton Mess and a Banoffee in a Tumbler.

On offer - at the same price! - are both Maison Ikkoku single origin, and a Toby&amp;#39;s Estate blend. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s surprisingly hard to get good coffee in CBD. Sure, there&amp;#39;s places like Jewel or the one in Chevron house whose name escapes me, but I find them unreliable, often with bitterness (i.e. stale beans and/or a bad roast), or serving the wrong texture because they don&amp;#39;t know how to foam milk properly. The local audience being business people having meetings they do not care that much about what they are drinking - this isn&amp;#39;t Tiong Bahru...<br&gt;<br&gt;I discovered the food court at the bottom of One Raffles Place as a result of a meeting there - despite living in Singapore for years I never noticed there were food courts in Raffles Place MRT! - and decided to give JAB a shot. It was pretty much a perfect flat white, with the double shot they put in every coffee, a well structured, lasting foam, and the coffee itself roasted to mild perfection, aromatic and with a long finish. The $5 was totally justified.<br&gt;<br&gt;Despite the limited seating - just 3 tall bar seats - and lack of cups, I&amp;#39;m going to be back whenever I need caffeine in CBD. This in my opinion is as much a coffee destination as Ikkoku, and considerably less crowded and more practical of access by public transport. <br&gt;<br&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t spot the brand or model of the machine but it is a magnificent piece of work."

They also have a lemon barley option (5 stars). I had the kaya toast as well, and it was also outstanding (5 stars). The bread was thin and crispy, unlike Ya Kun&amp;#39;s, and had a generous amount of kaya. The kaya is on the sweet side, but it&amp;#39;s not too bad with the bread and your drink to balance it out.

It is actually more of a food court than a restaurant, namely because you can&amp;#39;t order all your meals at one point (which is actually really annoying - I had to go to three different counters to get what I want, and only one of them sold water). However the servings are pretty generous (considering), and the food quite appetising. Mind you, to does get pretty crowded, and the staff can be a bit overzealous (and absent minded - one almost forgot to return my VISA card, that is until I reminded her).

It is also where you can get local style coffee and tea. Both teh (tea) and kopi (coffee) are good, strong and sweet, which is how I like my beverage to be. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food wise, it is very average. The nasi lemak comes with a sad looking piece of fried chicken, so unlike the version at Marina Bay Sands Shoppes. It is really something to be ordered only if you are desperately hungry or if you just want nasi lemak when inside the terminal. <br&gt;<br&gt;The soft boiled eggs and kaya toast are a better option though the toast gets cold very quickly.<br&gt;<br&gt;Mee siam and mee rebus are also not to die for. <br&gt;<br&gt;I guess that leaves the local coffee and tea the safest bet for ordering.

The vegetarian version and Hainanese chicken rice chili is good too but the prawn version is my fave.<br&gt;<br&gt;They have a nice Hainanese Chicken Rice, Chicken Biryani, tau pok, Rojak also.

Only has a few seats. Most people seem to takeaway.<br&gt;<br&gt;They do a daily rotation of breakfast item. Today&amp;#39;s was a guac sandwich with sous vide chicken. Well executed. Would have been nice if they could have a sweet item available as well but maybe the space is so small I suppose they just focus on doing one well which they did. Chicken was tender and guac was generous and balanced in seasoning.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve since tried many of their breakfast items and it&amp;#39;s all fresh and very homemade. Breads are nicely toasted. Coffee is always consistent and so yummy so this is a 5 star for me!

Apiary was the priciest at $7.50 for two smallish scoops, Lickety was $4.50 for a single scoop, and Creamier was $3.80 for a single scoop. Good pricing.<br&gt;<br&gt;Apiary: Star (2)<br&gt;Creamier: Star (2)<br&gt;Lickety: Star (2)<br&gt;<br&gt;Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?<br&gt;<br&gt;When it came to flavor and consistency, there was a clear winner here in Creamier, which had a fantastically smooth, creamy, and flavorful Salted Caramel. Lickety and Apiary were both good, but Apiary, the weakest of the three, was over frozen whereas Apiary was good but not great. <br&gt;<br&gt;Apiary: Single Star (3)<br&gt;Creamier: Two Stars (4)<br&gt;Lickety: Single Star (3)<br&gt;<br&gt;Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?<br&gt;<br&gt;Maybe surprisingly, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be excited to come back to any of these ice cream spots, but maybe that&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;m simply so spoiled by the stacked Los Angeles ice cream scene. <br&gt;<br&gt;Apiary: No Star (3)<br&gt;Creamier: No Star (4)<br&gt;Lickety: No Star (3)"

No wifi on site, self service for water and food collection (but they charge GST &amp;amp; service charge?), full parking lot right behind the store. If not, this outlet is about a 10 min walk from Tiong Bahru mrt Station. <br&gt;<br&gt;Waffles are great, you get 2 pieces of made-to-order Belgian waffles -- crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. $6 per 2 pieces can be pretty pricey, but it is a popular item. <br&gt;<br&gt;Roasted pistachio is my favourite flavour on their menu. Nutty, full-bodied flavour and nothing of that fake extract taste that you&amp;#39;ll get from cheaper options. It&amp;#39;s a premium flavour at $3.30 a scoop, but the ingredients are not skimped on. <br&gt;<br&gt;Other yums flavours:<br&gt;Earl grey lavender -- one of their classics. Not too sweet and aromatic. <br&gt;Plain ole chocolate -- May be boring but done right. Rich and bittersweet. <br&gt;Mango passionfruit sorbet -- tastes like (sweet) frozen mango in a pint. <br&gt;Matcha -- quite an elusive flavour but was surprisingly good, bittersweet and creamy. <br&gt;Banana chocolate chip crumble -- simple and good. Tastes like real banana!<br&gt;<br&gt;There are many many other flavours. Don&amp;#39;t feel shy to sample at the store! They have a 1 for 1 deal on Burpple Beyond for their ice cream and waffles. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re too lazy to head down to an outlet, they also deliver on GrabFood at $12 a pint for regular flavours, and $16 for premiums (+$3 delivery fee). Alternatively, order directly from Creamier and get free delivery over $60!"

Tried the carbonara pasta in my earlier visit. As expected, cream makes an unwanted appearance - when will people learn to make their damn carbonara without bloody cream. Despite the culinary faux pas, the creamy bacon pasta (I refuse to call it carbonara) is well constructed, and topped off with a runny half-cooked egg, which in this part of the world is a very tasty treat. Have yet to try the other dishes and I expect I will work my way through the menu as I pop over the rest of the year for my future grocery runs. <br&gt;<br&gt;Coffee tasted a touch burnt and overextracted. Definitely no 3rd wave here, despite the single origin bean declaration at the counter. Nonetheless, decent and always a better option than satanbucks. <br&gt;<br&gt;Had a slice of peanut butter banana cake - not overly sweet, but peanut butter flavour was somewhat absent. Still a pleasant tea time treat. <br&gt;<br&gt;Some craft beers on the menu, mainly Lost Coast stuff. Crowd pleasers for sure. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ll pop by again, buy only because there are so few options worth considering at Bukit Timah Plaza."

The prices are nett and there is no GST or service charge so you are spared the nasty shock that comes with the bill which you might get at some other cafes. <br&gt;<br&gt;I found the food portions quite small - they were also not very generous with the hollandaise sauce. The toasted bread was also a bit hard and dry. <br&gt;<br&gt;For a cafe that only recently opened its doors, I found the staff&amp;#39;s enthusiasm somewhat wanting and even a bit unfriendly. This affected the atmosphere in the cafe and I felt a constant brooding mood weighing on me as I finished up the not very impressive food. <br&gt;<br&gt;I may give this place another shot in future to see if these are just teething issues. All in all - quite a promising cafe in a good location but improvements are needed."

My friends and I were visiting from the US and wanted to go to a farm to the table restaurant. We were first a little worried about the pricing of the foods but we were shocked by the amazing foods. <br&gt;The only thing that bothered me a little was the mosquitos but that was due to us sitting outside for dinner around 6 pm. The waiter was very kind to let us use their mosquito spray repellent. <br&gt;The service was great and each waiter that served us was so caring and sweet. We ordered a mango soda and a glass of rosé for beverages which both were tasty and refreshing. I ordered the Apollo blue prawn aburi (blue plate) which was delicious. There was a kick of sweetness from the passion fruit and saltiness from the soy sauce. For our entrees we order the tiberias barramundi and sumataran crab tagliloni. Both were amazing and rich in flavor. <br&gt;We had a lovely time and it was worth the price.

Seriously, Singapore: you are raising your children to believe that healthy, locally sourced food is only for the elite? That giving good service and being polite comes at a price?<br&gt;<br&gt;That being said, I am happy that places as Open Farm Community exist and that I can afford going there now and then. The food is delicious and the service is how it should be. The watercress-kale soup is really good, but for 19$ I expect no less. I do wonder though: the other dish we had was beef rib eye: where do they source cows in Singapore?<br&gt;<br&gt;To me, Open Farm Community needs to seriously walk the talk. Their website reads that they want to connect the community to nature and  celebrate local spirit. In addition to being on the costly side, their location is not reachable without a car.  In a country where a lot of people do not own a car, this is not really helping to reach the local community.<br&gt;<br&gt;5 stars for the food &amp;amp; service but 3 stars for a concept mismatch so 4 stars overall."

We visited on a Sat morning at 11, right when it opened, without a reservation. We were turned away by the hostess, who informed us that the restaurant was fully booked till 3. She did offer to seat us at the bar, thankfully, which held only 4 people. Other customers who arrived later without reservations were turned away disappointedly - not a very smart move, given that I saw many empty tables that were being held for later reservations. Service staff weren&amp;#39;t very forthcoming nor friendly either, and the food did take some time to arrive. Not ideal for the brunch rush hour. <br&gt;<br&gt;Coffee is by Common Man, so they were expectedly decent. :)<br&gt;<br&gt;We tried:<br&gt;- Eggs Benedict with poached chicken, spinach, semi-dried tomatoes, sourdough &amp;amp; green curry hollandaise sauce ($24): eggs were beautifully poached, yolks were a rich golden orange. I particularly enjoyed the twist on the hollandaise though. The green curry taste definitely shone, though it might not be for everyone. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Truffle scrambled organic egg, shimeji mushrooms, portobello mushrooms, baby spinach &amp;amp; sourdough ($24): would recommend ordering this dish. The egg was soft and flavorful and the mushrooms were generously portioned. Went excellently on the sourdough. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Lemon tart with basil ice cream ($17): I&amp;#39;d heard so much about this dish before visiting that I HAD to order it (despite the price). It didn&amp;#39;t disappoint. Presentation was gorgeous and was reminiscent of a Mille-feuille. I&amp;#39;d have preferred the lemon curd to have been on the tarter side though. The basil ice cream was refreshing and went wonderfully with the lemon. Thoroughly enjoyed it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Portions aren&amp;#39;t big for the price, but we left satiated.

The pureed pumpkin gave a smooth texture to the dish but since there were many hidden ingredients that pops up with different flavors, I wasn&amp;#39;t able to tell which taste came from which. I love the seaweeds on the side. Gave the risotto more of a crunch. For the rice, I was wondering whether it was supposed to be hard instead of soft. A little confused here too as I was expecting it to be soft. <br&gt;<br&gt;This place only have one long communal table with high chairs. And we were given a time that we had to finish our food by as there might be another large group that come after us. Portion was a little small but I guess if you considered this place to be fine dining we should expect quality instead of quantity. Price was a little steep as well. <br&gt;<br&gt;Servers are pretty attentive especially when cups are towards little to no water. If you are coming during the weekends, I suggest that you make reservations especially for big groups."

The food was really good, but the menu was really tough if you&amp;#39;re trying to follow the Paleo lifestyle. Hubby order the roasted wagyu rump with ratte potatoes, poached eggs, red onions, chili bearnaise and brioche bun. Because of the quantity of food, he ended up eating the bread to fill up. I got the eggs benedict with poached chicken, spinach, semi-dried tomatoes, and green curry hollandaise sauce. I had them sub the sourdough for more spinach. I left hungry. Again, the food was awesome, but didn&amp;#39;t fit Paleo and portions were on the small side, so this place gets a 3.5/5 for me. <br&gt;<br&gt;I really did love the setting and the style of food they prepare, and would like to try my luck with their lunch or dinner menu. It&amp;#39;s still on my to do list and I promise to update this review once I&amp;#39;ve given those two menus a shot. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ultimately, go. Try. Enjoy. :)"

After the long wait, kids complaining that they were famished and the big bill we HAD to leave with more than half of the food still remaining on the table as it was quite difficult to eat, food had either no taste in it or such strong flavour that we couldn&amp;#39;t eat more than a few bites of each dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;It is a happening place right now, set lunches are good during a weekdays but I would say the rest of the time just save your self from wasting time, money and staying hungry and go elsewhere.

I really don&amp;#39;t.  I agree with a previous reviewer: Why is every single place in Singapore which serves good tasting, real food combined with good service expensive? Seriously, Singapore: you are raising your children to believe that healthy, locally sourced food is only for the elite? That giving good service and being polite comes at a price?<br&gt;<br&gt;That being said, I am happy that places as Open Farm Community exist and that I can afford going there now and then. The food is delicious and the service is how it should be. The watercress-kale soup is really good, but for 19$ I expect no less. I do wonder though: the other dish we had was beef rib eye: where do they source cows in Singapore?<br&gt;<br&gt;To me, Open Farm Community needs to seriously walk the talk. Their website reads that they want to connect the community to nature and  celebrate local spirit. In addition to being on the costly side, their location is not reachable without a car.  In a country where a lot of people do not own a car, this is not really helping to reach the local community.<br&gt;<br&gt;5 stars for the food &amp;amp; service but 3 stars for a concept mismatch so 4 stars overall."

We ordered a variety of food from the brunch, starters, pasta menu and ended with one of each of the dessert. A feast to say the least ! <br&gt;Of the starters that we ordered, I would say most everyone really enjoyed the warm salad of broccoli, pine nuts, peas, feta &amp;amp; mint. While it didn&amp;#39;t sound fancy at all - the combination worked really well - it tasted fresh with a good amount of crunch and creaminess from the cheese. The other starter that we loved as well was their take on the Caesar salad. Chicken was well moist and the individual slices of meat fit in nicely within a slice of lettuce + dressing - making it easy to pick up and eat, all the flavors in each bite ! <br&gt;We tried most of the pasta dishes and I have to say that they were all yummy, very well made and presented. The highlight for me was the mud crab pappardelle with thai curry sauce. Very unique combination that was creamy with a touch of spice. The crab added the bit of sweetness as well. We all finished that plate in a flash ! <br&gt;As for the desserts, they were all a treat for the eyes. Very colourful and well plated. I would say that they were good but a little lacking in taste as compared to the other courses. My favourite was the lemon tart  with the basil ice cream. <br&gt;The price is certainly steep - ended up around 80 dollars per person with minimal alcohol. We had a great time though - great place to have a relaxed lunch with friends ..."

This was well-executed, elegant, incredibly balanced, and the best caesar salad I&amp;#39;ve ever had. A must-try.<br&gt;<br&gt;2) Sweet Corn &amp;amp; Basil Soup ($19) chunked up with charred baby corn, caramelised onion strips, and mopped up by fluffy hunks of pita bread - velvety smooth and nuanced.<br&gt;<br&gt;3) Mud Crab Pappardelle ($29): the sweet flecks of shredded crabmeat complemented the mild Thai curry gravy swirled with coconut milk, dotted with yellow squash, and topped with fried Thai basil leaves. Despite the spice, this was very restrained.<br&gt;<br&gt;4) 48 Hour Barolo Braised Oxtail Strozzapreti ($26): unabashed and bold, the smoky sweet of the wine highlighted by the heft of the meat, and cut through by fresh thyme and parmesan crisps.<br&gt;<br&gt;5) Coconut Laksa Barramundi ($29): outstanding as well, the skin of the fish seared to a tantalising crackling, yielding luscious moist flesh underneath.

Chef Ryan Cliff brings to the table wholesome dishes, using as much produce as he can from the on site gardens and local farms. <br&gt;<br&gt;My favorite dish at OFC is the Coal-baked omelette with smoked haddock, tarragon and grain mustard mornay. I was surprised at the portion given that the rest of the dishes were minute (relative to their price point). This makes for the best brunch dish and i would gladly polish off the creamy eggs with chunks of salty fish. Now where is my bread?<br&gt;<br&gt;Sauteed local clams with pita and lemon meuniere sauce. Lovely briny morsels here but the portion was pathetic. A crunchy bread would work better than the pita, which turned kinda tough after being in the open for a bit.<br&gt;<br&gt;Local pumpkin with Minden Road pesto and pita bread. Well i love pumpkin but this is something anyone can do at home. For the price, i can easily buy a few pumpkins, instead of having just one sad sad slice. So nope, do not order this. And i don&amp;#39;t see how the pita even goes with the dish. In fact, it contributed to the overall dryness of this dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you would like a vegetable dish, then go with the Baby eggplant with spicy togarashi, quinoa, curry oil and sourdough. At least it&amp;#39;s more well thought out in terms of flavors and textures. I would say this has quite a Mediterranean-Asian flavor. <br&gt;<br&gt;For something more substantial, go for their handmade pastas which come in varieties other than the regular spaghetti and linguine. A hit for us was the Mud Crab Spaghettoni with Thai curry sauce, crunchy yellow squash, coconut, crispy shallot thai basil. Those delicious sweet chunks of crab!! Plus the chewy udon like spaghettoni with the mild creamy coconut curry. Can&amp;#39;t get enough of this! <br&gt;<br&gt;The Strozzapreti with 48 hour Barolo braised oxtail, parmesan wafers and wild thyme was also favored by some of my dining companions. The meat was a little too salty for me and it still had a gamey flavor. The texture was great though.<br&gt;<br&gt;A pretty and comforting dish was the Smoked duck cappelletti with baby spinach, dark brown chicken and thyme tea. I would finish the broth but i could not get past the thick pasta shells. Some tweaking needs to be done as the pasta stole the flavor from the meat.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Roasted baby chicken, braised leeks with hazelnut butter and wild watercress salad surprised me with the tender and juicy flesh despite its dryish appearance. It&amp;#39;s nothing very spectacular though. <br&gt;<br&gt;The 250g Charred Wagyu Burger with garlic fries and mayo was MEH. It was bland and blah and absolutely not worth the price tag or calories. A stronger tomato relish with pickles, cheese that melts better, and generally just a tad more seasoning (like pepper and salt).<br&gt;<br&gt;Sat at the Chef&amp;#39;s table and had full view of the open kitchen. :)<br&gt;<br&gt;Hits and misses but some dishes will have me coming back. Plus i really love the space here. :)"

Then Jim Thompson used it for a bit as a our side bar area.  Now its Open Farm Community.  As a member of the community I welcome it!<br&gt;<br&gt;Totally redo its reminds me of the farm to table restaurants in the USA.  Very shabby/rustic chic interior with wood floors and walls, floor to ceiling windows facing the herb farm.  Small bar area, open kitchen and cool lighting with reclaimed rot iron panels on the ceiling with fairy lights,  <br&gt;<br&gt;Try the chilled avocado soup, its to die for. I order it every time, clean, fresh, cooling for this climate.  Mains I&amp;#39;ve had are the barrumindi grilled to perfection and rigatoni is done with a pesto sauce that is not too oily or too basil infused.  I also have had the warm broccoli salad with pine nuts, just devine,  It is truly warm and not hot or luke warm.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you are in to clean eating, this is a place you need to try. Make reservations as the word is out, this place is the best clean eating restaurant in Singapore."

(6/10)<br&gt;- Design and layout - 9.5/10. The glass walls, surrounding nature and light ceiling makes it a really spectacular place to hang out for lunch or dinner.  Chairs are nice soft canvas type, very comfortable. Tables are a little unstable.<br&gt;- Not suitable as a working cafe. Extremely suitable if for fancy group meetups, dates, or if you just want to feel sophisticated. <br&gt;- While I appreciate the food decorations, I must note that all food has a mild-strong Indian style of taste. The food comes slightly spicy. <br&gt;- Eggplant with filing - simply not very well done at all. (5/10)<br&gt;- Salad with half boiled eggs,  bread, meat  was very well done. (8.5/10)<br&gt;- Main course of (fried) fish - mediocre at best. The fish felt like it came from a frozen source. Although I might be mistaken and the fish really is more gelatinous than chunky. I&amp;#39;m not buying the subtle South Asian spice that&amp;#39;s neither strong nor flavorful enough. It&amp;#39;s like making curry with minimal curry ingredients, then naming it something else entirely.<br&gt;- Pasta was superbly well done. Highly recommended. I really enjoyed the seafood addition to the pasta.<br&gt;- Coconut ice cream - taste wise  (7/10). Texture - melted far too quickly, lack of cream (3/10). Why are there torched /baked mangoes? It does not actuslly make it taste any differently. <br&gt;- Lemon tart was very good. I see the other revierwers praising it as well, it was actually very well done. (9/10)<br&gt;<br&gt;- Conclusion - marvelous place for a beautiful evening. Food was mediocre, although the general pricing and fanciness should entice one to enjoy it more.  Highly recommended if you want to impress your peers with your fine dining choices, and at those prices, they&amp;#39;ll enjoy the dishes without a doubt."

So 4 stars remained for that.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food I tried over the past visits were ok, not horrible and not so delicious that they deserved a repeat order. Maybe the place was too small to have a proper kitchen? It seemed like the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; food was just being heated up before serving. <br&gt;<br&gt;The corn fritters were more like fluffy pancakes with corn in them. Definitely not what I imagined them to be, and certainly not like those at Bills in Sydney. Hey, Jamaica Blue is from Australia after all. Can&amp;#39;t blame me for the correlation. With the texture like pancakes, I wish there was some sauce to pour over the &amp;#34;fritters&amp;#34;. It was just so dry that I actually resorted to sprinkling white sugar over them as if I was eating prata like a child. It was much better with the sugar. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their sandwiches and salad selection do look quite good though. Maybe their cold food will be much better. Next time."

It was among the best cups of coffee I have had in Singapore. <br&gt;I ordered the bacon and egg sandwich while my wife had the &amp;#34;avocado smash&amp;#34;, which appeared to be basically the same thing with fresh avocado. I thought the bacon was excellent and really enjoyed the breakfast sandwich. At about $13 it was pretty reasonable my Singapore standards as well. <br&gt;Since we had almost the whole place to ourselves, we got excellent service. There are only about 6 tables indoors but there lots outdoors. Was frankly surprised that no one else was there. <br&gt;My only (very minor) complaint was that the is significantly different than the one online (we had scoped it out before heading down).

I was looking for a place to do some work, and unfortunately, on a Monday, there were quite a number of cafes closed. Luckily I stumbled upon this one, and was greeted very nicely by their staff. I was recommended the new Green eggs and ham muffin, which I promptly ordered out of curiosity (avocado and ham btw) along with a latte. The seating is upstairs and very quaint and quiet, perfect for spending an afternoon relaxing and enjoying the food and drink, or whip out a book to read. The muffin itself was a little on the savoury side, but in terms of texture and consistency, it was soft and moist on the inside, and the avocado tastes fresh and melted in my mouth. Definitely a place to consider dropping by if you need a quick bite or an entire afternoon. Plus, free wifi is always a huge plus point!"

Located opposite Telok Ayer station and next to Moosehead, The Muffinry has a huge expanded seating area spanning three floors. I was already marveling at the many mismatched wooden tables and chairs on the second floor, before I realized there was a loft upstairs with even more seating AND natural light!! (I love lofts.) The second floor was a little dark for my taste. I especially like how the furniture and decor felt like home, not like those cheap blander ikea sets at many cafes. I had the loft to myself for almost an hour too, before the mid afternoon crowd surged in. With lively and loud conversation, as well as the radio playing instead of a playlist of songs, it&amp;#39;s a fun atmosphere to catch up with friends too. Also, the aircon is just the right strength (very important in this weather lol) and there&amp;#39;s a bathroom. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered a skinny latte, and it was good and I enjoyed it immensely. I&amp;#39;m not enough of a coffee connoisseur to say anything more sophisticated than that!!<br&gt;<br&gt;This is not a review for the eponymous muffins: they were freshly baked, looked delicious, were pretty affordable for ~$3, but I&amp;#39;m trying reaaally hard to eat less baked goods. I&amp;#39;ll probably cave next time &amp;amp; will update this review once I try it! <br&gt;<br&gt;The staff are also really friendly and helpful, proactively introducing their baked goods (and telling me they had free wifi before I even asked) in a non pushy way. Usually cafe staff are pretty snooty, but I felt very welcome here."

But the muffinry cupcakes...are of a different class. They seem to possess that little home-made goody quality that implores me to explore them beyond their outer shell. I duly did that with my now favourite fig and earl grey muffin, and have never looked back. <br&gt;<br&gt;An absolutely glorious cupcake if I&amp;#39;d ever had one. The earl grey taste was fantastic, and its cirtus qualities brought out by two fairly sizable bits of fig that quite literally spiced up the cupcake. The consistency of the cupcake was formidable again, crumbling perfectly, though not annoyingly. With such skill to make such a good cupcake, I&amp;#39;m already looking forward to my next one."

While I still hold a healthy skepticism with regards to the quality of cafe food, I am delighted to discover some stellar food here, thanks to the <br&gt;recommendation by a coffee guru friend<br&gt;<br&gt;Gelato is no longer a novelty but there is something playful when it comes to the Italian ice cream here. It&amp;#39;s Gelato desserts. This magnum-lookalike &amp;#34;Milk Chocolate Classico&amp;#34; might not be convince you to splurge $10 but wait till you sink your teeth into the chocolate shell. Instead of the typical artificial-tasting buttery ice confectionary, a dense caramel brownie-like layer concealed in the fresh and smooth vanilla gelato, made it extremely pleasurable yet gratifying. Count yourself lucky if you managed to detonate one of their &amp;#34;BOMB&amp;#34; (bizzare ice cream balls), especially the salted caramel version which was unavailable during my visit.<br&gt;<br&gt;Same goes for the Matcha &amp;amp; Black Sesame gelato ($2.50/$3 for premium). Yes, these might be my two favourite flavors but there is a reason why they are standouts of their own species. The Black sesame gelato grabbed our attention away from its matcha counterpart due to its warm earthy nuttiness, thanks to the incorporation of grinded BS seeds and BS paste. But be forewarned that the sugar content for both flavours were askew. Waffles ($5) were light and delicately crisp on the edges, crawling in with subtle honey sweetness. <br&gt;<br&gt;Cakes are not as stellar as the gelato so expect standards to fluctuate with the nature of pastries. Baked goods like the Strawberry Rose Red Velvet ($4.50) had a stale, uninspiring rose buttercream, clearly not performing at its utmost. Though neither coffee nor orange was discernible in the Ivory Orange Coffee Mousse ($4.50), the texture of the mousse was smooth and wholesome. <br&gt;<br&gt;While there is a range of other cakes such as Peanut Banana, Tiramisu and cheesecakes, I&amp;#39;m contented with their gelato creations, which I hope can be further experimented and one day expand to become the forte of the cafe, apart from waffles and coffee."

Well I&amp;#39;m from the states for Starbucks are usually go to is always busy so guess what that just means to you soon specially when this place is located inside of the mall. I love Starbucks and I will go anywhere for Starbucks. Customer service here is awesome. But like I said in the beginning of the review this is inside of them all and it&amp;#39;s always busy and like I said it&amp;#39;s inside of the mall. I think you get the point. Lol OK and all seriousness this place is very wide open lotta people noisy and I think the staff here might be understaffed. I see that because if I was the manager here I would just overstep this place to make sure that the demand is Capt to an orderly manner. Either way you know how I love this place

I was however left a bit more hesitant after the barista approached me when I was looking at the coffee beans on their shelf as his response when I asked him if it was a single origin or a blend was that it was dark roast. I still decided to sample a cup of their coffee and it was not horrible but also not great.<br&gt;<br&gt;This location in Orchard Central is perhaps good in some ways but also the cafe sort of feels as it is in middle of where people walk so I do not really like that aspect of it. They do however offer free wifi which is a plus. Sampled a sandwich as well and it was a standard café style sandwich so no better or worse than I would have gotten at Starbucks or Costa&amp;#39;s so while not bad it does not really add much either.

It was a small cafe so getting this table can be frustrating, depending on the time of the day. <br&gt;<br&gt;The boss is friendly and sociable and thanks to him we got to know a bit of history of this little cafe and sample some biscuits. We ordered the raspberry scone and for myself, a glass of cold coffee (cafe&amp;#39;s speciality) and it is definitely worth it. Prices is pretty reasonable and I would definitely come back to try the others. <br&gt;<br&gt;About the Scone - absolutely delicious. Little bit sweet for my liking but this is certainly one to enjoy for every morning before your day starts. No wonder the duchess of this venue comes here so often! As for the coffee, I think it&amp;#39;s worth trying it especially for the first timers. For $4.50, it&amp;#39;s definitely value for money. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I enjoyed my time there and would certainly recommend you to drop by there to try the scones. There are seats outside the cafe, but if the place is full, just take it away and enjoy it somewhere else. There are a couple of Malls nearby to enjoy the air con and the scone!"

Reasons why:<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Good location: <br&gt;a short 5 min walk from Eunos MRT station (EW green line). Eunos Station is situated in the east area, near to the historical Joo Chiat area. <br&gt;<br&gt;2. Yummy food prepared with a lot of heart: <br&gt;the owners do not believe in cutting corners when it comes to food. They prepare everything from scratch; they bake their own breads, prepare their own yummy cakes &amp;amp; tarts, prepare the food (sandwiches, pasta etc) from fresh ingredients. They serve coffee &amp;amp; tea; Selection ain&amp;#39;t that wide. That&amp;#39;s because they rather concentrate on preparing good food instead of serving so many types of coffee/tea. <br&gt;<br&gt;3. Unpretentious place &amp;amp; laid back atmosphere:<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s a small cafe but it&amp;#39;s pretty cosy with nice decor. The inside of the cafe sits about 4, while there are about 3 tables for 2 pax outside. <br&gt;<br&gt;4. Excellent service:<br&gt;Too bad there are only 5 stars in yelp, for service, I&amp;#39;ll give 10 stars. They are most attentive and will top up my water (complimentary) without asking. Always ready with a smile &amp;amp; a chat, the owners &amp;amp; staff made you feel most welcomed. <br&gt;<br&gt;What I&amp;#39;ll love to try next is their customised cakes. Plan to order them for future celebrations. <br&gt;<br&gt;Open Mon - Sat: 8am - 8pm. <br&gt;Closed on Sundays."

It&amp;#39;s a hidden gem with yummy food!<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always ordered Brave Begedil - which is very yummy. The portion for this one is not very big, so if you are that hungry this meal wouldn&amp;#39;t be that filling for you. I looove the turkey bacon! <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also ordered lavender latte. Iove love love."

I even went twice on the first day.<br&gt;<br&gt;Milk coffees for $4.50. About 5.5 to 6oz? Microfoam held its shape well after some time had passed even though I had mine skinny. The beans aren&amp;#39;t that special flavour profile wise but a good reliable cup and Aslam did a great job pulling and steaming. He&amp;#39;s a regular from the Plain and he said he will be stationed here now which suits me fine! In fact, I think my two cups here were more flavourful than the last one I had at the Plain. One of my friends had the iced coffee with soy, I had a sip. I&amp;#39;m not a fan of ice coffee but it was tasty and less money than other places at $5.50 for basic add $0.80 for soy. <br&gt;<br&gt;Scone..I was a bit surprised at the price $4.50 but it was bigger than average and it was very buttery with great texture, not the bready types so common nowadays. So I can&amp;#39;t say it was overpriced. They took the effort to warm it up but it was quite a long wait for just a scone..it was served it with a slice of butter and yummy blueberry jam. If there was clotted cream, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised at the price..hehe<br&gt;<br&gt;Steak Ciabatta $13: I was worried it wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough but when I finished it, I was well satisfied. Nice chunk size of steaks inside AND (very important for someone who broke her jaw before) tender and easy to bite through. The only thing to improve..it was getting a bit dry towards the end (albeit I did eat it slowly because I was enjoying the conversation so much). Perhaps some dijon mustard or a salsa dip served on the side would help extend it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Brave Begedil $17: This was like a beef hash with 2 poached eggs, avocado and 2 perfectly thin crispy bacon slices on it. My friend ordered it and she commented that the bacon was very tasty. The eggs were perfectly done, she literally oohed with delight when the yolk oozed out and insisted I capture it on camera. Looking at the menu, I realise the bacon is turkey, probably that&amp;#39;s why it had unexpected flavour. The portion did not look that big but again my friend was well content after finishing it for brunch. I noticed the avocado looked a bit brown...<br&gt;<br&gt;Much has been made of the decor. It&amp;#39;s a bit...chintzy..and trust me I have never used that word before or even typed it so I had to lookup the spelling and meaning but turns out it&amp;#39;s perfect. It works for me if its meant to be no frills coz it&amp;#39;s chintzy in a budget way..not really quirky quaint. Food prices are a touch high. The food is fresh and honest though so I don&amp;#39;t feel overcharged, it just isn&amp;#39;t quite a bargain and I think they priced their coffee reasonably and try to make more on the food. When it fills up it can get really noisy. Not a place for heart to hearts.<br&gt;<br&gt;Update 28 September 2013: They just changed their chairs and stools which are now much more comfortable!<br&gt;<br&gt;There&amp;#39;s parking about but it can be busy with lots of lorries and industrial type things in the area.<br&gt;<br&gt;I deliberated between 4 and 5 and I think if the food was a bit cheaper, I could rate it 5 stars. I guess I compare it to other places like Toby&amp;#39;s Estate and for similar prices, their plates would be a bit more hearty looking and in a more prime location."

Brunch called for a trip to The Bravery at Horne Road and i was hopeful that it&amp;#39;d be as good as The Plain and Ronin as it&amp;#39;s opened by the same folks.<br&gt;<br&gt;Typical sign-less cafe but this time i even had a hard time finding the door! As for the decor, well it&amp;#39;s one thing to be minimalist, another to be &amp;#39;can&amp;#39;t be bothered&amp;#39; and this seems to fall into the latter category. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unfinished wooden planks on DIY metal frames and concrete slabs make uncomfortable tables and chairs that are also potentially hazardous and the electrician obviously wasn&amp;#39;t paid to do his job with the lights. Tables are wooden planks on top of simple metal frames and concrete slabs. The general environment felt make-shift and the noise level was deafening despite the 60% capacity when i visited. Not quite a place to hang around for long.<br&gt;<br&gt;Coffee is made using the same Genovese blend from Brazil, which is robust but not acidic. The Lavender latte ($5.50) had a fragrant aroma and was lightly sweetened but there&amp;#39;s a light bitter aftertaste that wasn&amp;#39;t present in the flat white. Perhaps that came from the dried lavender.<br&gt;<br&gt;Great Flat White ($4.50) with superb crema. Drinks like a dream.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food menu is rather limited, as with the usual The Plain and Ronin style but the regular eggs on toast, pancakes and some savory mains and sandwiches were available.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Brave Begedil ($17) was a Bravery recommendation. Poached eggs with Turkey Bacon (wert no real bacon?!!) and Avocado on Corned Beef Begedil Hash. If you don&amp;#39;t know what Begedil is, it&amp;#39;s a Malay potato patty with onions and coriander. I was looking forward to digging in and that was when i noticed my missing avocado. And it was only after i asked about it was i told that they ran out of avocado and the replaced it randomly with another slice of turkey bacon. Seriously?! So you weren&amp;#39;t gonna tell me if i didn&amp;#39;t ask? Never not cross a hungry woman. NEVER. Oh the same thing happened to the customer next table too.<br&gt;<br&gt;It was a further slap in the face with the overdone poached eggs and papery whites. Nothing in this dish stood out and the bacon was terribly dry and sweet. I should have ordered the Beef Steak Ciabatta ($13.50) which had good reviews on the juicy rump steak silvers or that Ricotta Cheese Pancakes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Spotty service was yet again displayed with our second order. We ordered the Crostini ($7.50) shortly after the Begedil and it was only served when we were way done with the first dish. I think i spent a good 10 mins playing with the leftovers and the crostini still didn&amp;#39;t come.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well at least it was a huge portion when it finally came. Well sauteed Aubergine (aka Eggplant aka Brinjal aka that mushy plant) cooked with Chickpeas, served on on Sourdough Toast with Mint Leaves and Crumbled Feta Cheese. This Vegetarian Greek breakfast is a departure from my regular brunch items but i found it rather refreshing with the sharp kick from the feta. <br&gt;<br&gt;Would i go back to The Bravery again? The answer is no. Especially not when there are so many cafes popping up in the hood. If you want a better brunch, head on to Ronin (read review here), which does the best brunch out of their 3 outlets."

Sadly I was kinda disappointed; my fiancé and I felt the coffee could be stronger - it was a bit it too milky for our liking. The lavender made the coffee taste interesting, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t have more than one cup. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food wise this place wasn&amp;#39;t too bad; I think they take reviews seriously because we didn&amp;#39;t have to wait 40 minutes for our crab cakes, so that was a plus. I liked their spin on fish and chips (made a spicy tartar sauce which was delicious). <br&gt;<br&gt;As far as accessibility goes, a bit difficult to reach if it were raining (which happened)."

It&amp;#39;s covered in fairy lights, there are milk crates everywhere and the design centrepiece is a papier-mache horse with a gold trim. Others have compared the design to a tool shed but there are no tools here, just empty space and a few odd design cues. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food is also not to my taste. The menu seems to have  nothing coherent to tie it together. It&amp;#39;s limited and full of extraordinarily simple dishes that I would not pay the kind of premium expected by The Bravery for. I ordered the &amp;#34;Raunchy Eggs&amp;#34; and was mostly underwhelmed.<br&gt;<br&gt;And the coffee? Another mystery. I hear that the proprietor behind The Bravery and The Plain takes Melbourne coffee culture as his inspiration. Why then would he go to the trouble of importing coffee from Genovese? There are so many better options, Department of Caffeine is importing 5 Senses, for example. Or why not support the local community by buying locally roasted coffee from Palheta and its ilk? It tastes much better!<br&gt;<br&gt;Now back to the milk crates. Why would a restaurateur think that his clientele are going to pay a premium to sit on milk crates? Industrial/warehouse-style venue design should not render a place uncomfortable. It should be about adding a slightly more raw look to your restaurant, not diminish the comfort.<br&gt;<br&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about you but I&amp;#39;m not prepared to pay a &amp;#34;cool-cafe-premium&amp;#34; to be less comfortable than I would at my local kopitiam.<br&gt;<br&gt;Maybe some Singaporeans will patronise a place because of an unquantifiable cool factor.

Bit of a random and grammatically odd name for a cafe, but we were excited nonetheless, since the folks behind it are the same ones who own The Plain.<br&gt;<br&gt;It was a good thing I&amp;#39;d googled for pictures of the cafe before visiting, because the freaking place DOES NOT HAVE A SIGN. The shopfront consists of five translucent panels: The gold one in the middle&amp;#39;s the door, which is flanked on both sides by red immobile panels. If you push repeatedly on the red ones you&amp;#39;ll be rewarded with stares from the patrons inside the cafe, having already replaced their own embarrassment with the right to judge the inexperienced.<br&gt;<br&gt;Mocha, $5.10; Flat White, $4.50 - I didn&amp;#39;t use to have a preferred type of coffee blend - that changed the moment I tasted the Genovese coffee offered here. The foam atop my mocha was velvety, and the coffee was smooth with just a hint of nutty caramel. It sure helped that the drink was beautifully presented, and the chocolate used was of premium quality. Though the scent of Genovese coffee is muted in comparison with the strong fragrance typical of coffee prepared with the roasts from Papa Palheta and Liberty Coffee, it also doesn&amp;#39;t leave the slightly sour aftertaste that the two latter blends do.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pancakes Stack, $15.00 - Eaten individually, the pancakes here are serviceable if a little mushy. Spread some ricotta cheese in between the layers of pancakes, dip them into the pool of honey and chopped pistachios, and be sure to include a sliver of banana with every mouthful of pancakes. The mildly sweet cheese elevates this dish from an average one into one that gets increasingly addictive.<br&gt;<br&gt;Raunchy Eggs, $14.00 - Two sunny side-ups, a side of spicy beans and anchovies, and a pile of shredded cabbage on a soft tortilla shell - these came together really nicely, with the creaminess of the yolk providing a textural contrast to the crunchiness of the raw cabbage. The eggs, seasoned with pepper, salt and strips of scallion, were quite outstanding. For a dish with such a suggestive name, however, it could afford to have a little more spunk. Wasn&amp;#39;t a fan of the not-at-all spicy beans and anchovies and the blandly chewy tortilla shell, which I thought tasted like watered-down Mexican food.<br&gt;<br&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s intentional, but the interior of The Bravery Cafe is so sparsely furnished it&amp;#39;s amusing. Diners sit on overturned crates, tabletops are made from boards of plywood, walls are unevenly painted and strings of bulbs extend from the ceiling in an incongruous fashion. I guess they were going for the let&amp;#39;s-have-gourmet-coffee-in-a-tool-shed vibe, but the decor kind of falls flat for me. It&amp;#39;s like someone thought it would be a good idea to open for business midway through the renovation process. Or maybe I just lack the sophistication to appreciate industrial chic.<br&gt;<br&gt;On the upside, the service here at The Bravery Cafe is stellar. The wait staff, and even the baristas, are friendly without being intrusive. They made the effort to check in on every table. This, coupled with the fact that they serve possibly my favorite cup of coffee on the whole island, is reason enough for me to be back. I just hope I have cakes to go with my coffee the next time I&amp;#39;m here."

Before I had a chance to order, I was served twice with delicious looking food that I of course did not order. As soon as I ordered, I was presented with a waffle that I did not order either. Seriously??<br&gt;<br&gt;Food wise, it was pretty good. I ordered their corn and zucchini fritters that came with spinach and a poach egg. The flavors were just right and portion reasonable for the price.<br&gt;<br&gt;So why not more stars? The ambiance were just rushed and unorganized for a cafe. While their food was good, it was not the best and with so many unique cafés in Singapore, there really is no reason to come back here. Definitely not on a laid back Sunday."

This is practically an institution amongst the hipster crowd, methinks.<br&gt;<br&gt;I used to work across the road from this place and so it was the to-go whenever my colleagues and I felt like having something different from the usual hawker food in the area. It was also my source of comfort food/coffee in the early mornings, after working through the night. As such I have eaten here so many times that this review is going to be a bit too long...<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Coffee - I find the coffee here too acidic- from lattes to mochas to their famed &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; (the first time a coworker asked me to help him order this I looked at him dubiously as though he was asking me to get him some drugs). Umm... good if you like your coffees sour but IMO Highlander&amp;#39;s down the block is much better.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Brunch - have never gone wrong with the brunch options here, your usual eggs-and-toast. Scrambled eggs were much better than the poached from what I remember. <br&gt;<br&gt;3. Lunch - pastas are good, but get the truffle fries and the more special spam fries with lime kafir mayo to share! Spam fries are so so so sinful but go really well with the lime mayo - my ultimate comfort food after an overnight shift.<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Dinner - had beef tacos here a really long time ago which were MEH - dry, tasteless, bland, looks like it was put together in less than a minute. But I heard that they&amp;#39;ve changed their dinner menu<br&gt;<br&gt;BUT THE REAL GEM IN THIS PLACE IS<br&gt;WAFFLES! Their waffles look VERY typical and nothing too extraordinary but they are perfect! (Was not surprised when the folks here decided to open a waffle shop next door) Fluffy, light, not too dense- looks simple but tastes SO GOOD. In fact these are probably my favourite waffles in Singapore! If you only have space for one thing, get the waffles. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."

Strangers Reunion is one of those cafes, and it doesn&amp;#39;t disappoint. This is an interesting cafe, with a very distinct look and atmosphere, and most importantly, well crafted coffee.<br&gt;<br&gt;The espresso shot had a light mouthfeel, but a strong and robust flavour. It wasn&amp;#39;t bitter or citrusy - the dominant flavour was woody and earthy. This is an interesting combination, and it worked for me. The crema on the shot was dark brown, and the volume was correct - this tells me that it&amp;#39;s a shot made from fresh beans, extracted for the correct length of time. Bonus points for the friendly staff, who knew exactly what blend of beans were used, and were happy to talk coffee. This is great - I love seeing this in a cafe - staff who clearly love coffee too.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered a cappuccino too. This was smooth as silk, with soft foam, and steamed to perfection. The coffee flavour is slightly muted by the milk, but is still there - it&amp;#39;s a good mix of taste and texture, and one of the better cappuccinos that I&amp;#39;ve had. There is an underlying sweetness also - this is from the lactose in the milk itself, and is brought out by steaming. More importantly, it is brought about by steaming at an appropriate temperature - it&amp;#39;s a learned skill, and this tells me that this was an experienced barista. The foam layer was about right too - by no means was this one of the &amp;#34;latte in disguise&amp;#34; coffees that I&amp;#39;ve noticed in a few places lately. <br&gt;<br&gt;The overall aesthetic is quite distinct - I like the overall effect. The cement floor, rugs, subdued lighting and unique furniture ensure that Strangers has carved out it&amp;#39;s own niche, distinguishing itself from any number of independent cafe&amp;#39;s which have opened lately. I quite like that the cafe doubles as a gallery, supporting local artists - something that encourages repeat visits.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, this was a good coffee experience, and there is one more coffee place that I can add to the list of places that I would recommend to friends. What stands out for me were the staff, more than one of whom asked about the standard of coffee - this is a sign of staff who are engaged in what they are doing, and want to serve good shots. They did, and I&amp;#39;ll be back for more."

I&amp;#39;ve heard so much about the place and we had some time to kill so we decided to pay the cafe a visit.<br&gt;<br&gt;So it is actually beside a big main road in a row of shophouses with a super eclectic mix of tenants.<br&gt;<br&gt;The cafe is actually a long rectangular space. When we stepped in the place was positively buzzing. I quite liked the decor up front though. Very typical of indie cafes, but its charming nonetheless. <br&gt;<br&gt;Coffees and teas are $3.5-$8. I heard the barista is quite well-known among the indie coffee scene.<br&gt;<br&gt;So what happened was that there were a few class gatherings just right beside us on the right that filled up the entire cafe with loud sounds. It was at least 15 people squeezed up against tiny tables just chattering in competing volumes. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had a iced latte once again, while my friend ordered a latte. Our friend had a sandwich which looked quite mediocre and tasted just so as well. For the coffee itself, I really cannot give it an accurate rating.<br&gt;<br&gt;What I can say was that the crowd and the noise actually drove us away and I was downing my iced latte like it was a glass of vodka cranberry. Perhaps the crowd took the word &amp;#34;reunion&amp;#34; quite literally and held their class reunions there.<br&gt;<br&gt;However I do see the potential in this place - if there are only a few human beings around. I can imagine it as a quiet cafe that will go perfectly with a book and some Olivia Ong.<br&gt;<br&gt;It being sufficiently close to Tanjong Pagar/Outram also makes it relatively easy to revisit."

Best not to try big groups - that&amp;#39;ll just spoil your experience.<br&gt;<br&gt;The menu options is pretty limited but it makes sense since they have only a tiny &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34;, or rather counter space. I heard a lot about their buttermilk waffles so I decided to order them topped with greek yoghurt and fruit. I liked it enough to decide to come back again for you, so you definitely should give it a go.<br&gt;<br&gt;I also had a cup of their &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; coffee. Checking up online, I learnt that it was made with 2 shots of ristretto so expect a rather strong drink balanced with nicely frothed milk. It had a familiar taste profile to Terra Firma of Loysels&amp;#39; Toy/Papa Pahelta fame but is bolder in execution. <br&gt;<br&gt;The cakes and pies aren&amp;#39;t as exciting looking though.

One of the biggest allures to drinking coffee at an &amp;#34;atas&amp;#34; joint like this is the story behind the coffee.

It essentially is a roasted meat shop that conveniently sells drinks too. Well, a roasted meat shop that just happens to sell my favourite wanton mee in singapore. <br&gt;<br&gt;It definitely helps that the roasted char siew is done the way it should be, the way that many char siew shops around the country just can&amp;#39;t seem to get right. I&amp;#39;ve never been a fan of char siew that is painted in artificial red; for me that is the surest warning sign that I&amp;#39;m not in for a good one. The colour of this roast pork is a sweet, deep, caramel brown, quietly revealing the time, effort and skill that resulted in this creation. Oh, and they are not stingy in their portion of this beautiful meat -at all-.<br&gt;<br&gt;And then the noodles are absolutely perfect. The noodles are silky yet softly solid, and as you slurp them be careful of not splashing the wonderfully savoury and sweet sauce all around you, and I have clumsily managed to do on so many occasions, probably because of how slippery and smooth the texture of the noodles are. <br&gt;<br&gt;The wantons are good too - a little mixture of texture in it, with the smooth soft skin on the outside and some crunchy bits within the minced meat within. The soup&amp;#39;s pretty good too. I think you get the point - it&amp;#39;s all really good, but I&amp;#39;m not making it sound as good as it is probably because of how GREAT the noodles and the char siew are.<br&gt;<br&gt;If that doesn&amp;#39;t draw you in, maybe the little price of $4 for the whole shebang will tempt you"

But fairly tender meat, where there was it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Wontons had the crunch of water chestnut bits in it, pretty gd soup.<br&gt;<br&gt;Guess I wasn&amp;#39;t crazily wowed by it, but it was pretty good. Would like to try their soy sauce chicken next time!"

The rave reviews I had heard firsthand from other foodies I respected confused and intrigued me and ultimately buoyed my interest enough to carry me through the doors of Violet Oon&amp;#39;s Bukit Timah once again.<br&gt;<br&gt;Executive micro-summary:  Dinner was spectacular.<br&gt;<br&gt;We had the Gado Gado and Ngoh Hiang to start.  The Gado Gado had wonderfully crunchy barely blanched long beans, goose down pillow soft rice cakes, and a sauce that was playfully piquant boasting flavors of lemon grass and kaffir lime leaf.  The whole thing just made sense and wasn&amp;#39;t over-presented.  It arrived simply and spoke for itself.  I have to say that it acquitted itself admirably.  The Ngoh Hiang was a a delight and easily one of the highlights of the evening for me.  Texturally full of contrasts showing off a crispy deep-fried skin encasing steamy gently yielding stuffing and full pieces of succulent meat.  The flavors were spot on for this one dish when you put the whole thing together, hunk of Ngoh Hiang, achar, brush of sambal chili lime, and a drizzle of sweet sauce...divine, just absolutely mind-glowingly good.  Honestly, it was humbling to witness so much skill and experience in bringing balance to this dish.  It all just made sense and it wasn&amp;#39;t showy, and the textural and flavor contrasts were there and then a mere blissful memory.  <br&gt;<br&gt;After that opening, the meal just kept getting better and was followed by Beef Rendang.  Hunks of loin and shin prepared in the time-honored fashion of slowly stirring a coconut curry sauce till it coats a spoon.  Having some experience in nonya kitchen, I know this to be an exercise in restraint and a demonstration of infinite patience.  Again this was served up without pretension, and a beautiful confidence in the tradition of beef rendang to be able to wow and elicit the very predictable response of a sharp intake of breath, followed by salivary overactivity.  Garnished with no more than finely julienned kaffir lime leaf, this dish brazenly dared me not to be impressed.  I was appropriately submissive and barely kept from weeping with joy with every sublime mouthful of rendang and jasmine rice...carb count be damned.<br&gt;<br&gt;Finishing off with one of Chef Oon&amp;#39;s signature desserts, the Gula Melaka Cake with a scoop of coconut ice cream a la mode hammered home the final nails in the coffin of doubt about this jewel of a Singapore restaurant.  My faith is restored, I am born again whole."

Or rather her children open and manage the restaurant while I believed she supervises and rules over the kitchen. A real family business. <br&gt;<br&gt;I saw the pictures my friend took when she dined there during Restaurant Week last year and I just had to try them too. It looked that appetizing. I managed to snag a table during the Restaurant Week promotion and was in for a treat. That was really a good introduction as the ala carte prices were pretty high for nonya food. <br&gt;<br&gt;The restaurant was done in a mostly black and white decor, with clean lines, reminiscent of a Parisian cafe. The washrooms had little touches of warmth with diffuser and nice hand soap bottle (whether the content is really of that is another question). <br&gt;<br&gt;Restaurant Week Menu (October 2012)<br&gt;Appetizer - 2 dip board with pita bread and buah keluak sambal dip and chili crab dip. They came on a wooden board which was a nice touch. This was pretty awesome and set the stage for what was to come. Surprisingly the chili crab dip was spicier than the buah keluak sambal dip and we pretty much scraped every little bit out from the tiny ramekin pot. <br&gt;<br&gt;Mains<br&gt;Dry laksa - so yummy with the little bits of crunchy dried shrimps (hae bee) dotting almost every strand of the noodle. It is also quite lemak so it is much better to share this. <br&gt;<br&gt;Babi pong tay - I rarely take pork but I could become a convert after trying this. The braised pork belly just melted in the mouth and there was no porky taste or smell at all. Must try. Again, maybe better to share this so you don&amp;#39;t get tired of it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Dessert<br&gt;Sticky date pudding with vanilla ice cream - I like the caramel sauce over it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Pulot hitam with vanilla ice cream - not too sweet and the ice cream added the sweetness. I like this. <br&gt;<br&gt;We went back again and ordered from the a la carte menu. The menu does not really have dishes to share as each dish comes with its own serving of rice, salad and pickles (achar). What you are supposed to do if you want to share is to put the dish in the center and voila, you could share them. <br&gt;<br&gt;Other dishes tried:<br&gt;Fish tempra which was fried sea bass fillet with chili a sweet, sour and spicy sauce which was quite ok and the ayam buah keluak was also quite good though I would not say it is the best I had. <br&gt;<br&gt;Other dishes which were recommended were the pulled beef ragu rigatoni and shepherd pie which I have not tried yet."

(as picked by Nik, whose awesome poetic review is right below this one)<br&gt;<br&gt;Tried the Asian big breakfast (nice but portions were a bit small, rice a bit dry and not fragrant enough, otah was very good though), babi pong tay (nice but very small, best to order for sharing), tau kwa (ok only), vietnamese pulled pork burrito (nice but tasted more mexican than anything)<br&gt;<br&gt;I thought that the desserts were the highlight of the meal!<br&gt;<br&gt;Durian cendol panna cotta - having just come back from Penang less than 2 weeks ago I&amp;#39;ve been having some serious cendol cravings and this hit the spot! Comes in a tall glass with layers of cendol toppings/durian and the panna cotta at the top, with a cup of gula melaka to pour in an mix as you please. This was a really good dessert and I would return for this.<br&gt;<br&gt;Sticky toffee date pudding - quite a good rendition, on par (but not superior to) the ones at Marmalade Pantry/PS Cafe. <br&gt;<br&gt;Tapioca cake with gulak melaka and coconut cream - not die-die-must-try but quite a good version of tapioca cake, I couldn&amp;#39;t resist gobbling this down either. It&amp;#39;s not too cloying/sweet. I ordered this for takeaway so I don&amp;#39;t know how it&amp;#39;s usually presented on a plate, but you have to eat the cake with both the gulak melaka and coconut cream for maximum enjoyment. Tastes a bit plain on its own.<br&gt;<br&gt;Bread and butter pudding with whiskey and custard sauce - nice (ie. I would eat it if it were placed in front of me) but not spectacular (I&amp;#39;d order the other desserts instead).<br&gt;<br&gt;The place has a nice ambience, similar to PS cafe. Wait staff were very very polite and accommodating. <br&gt;<br&gt;Will come back soon to try the dry laksa/otah panini and of course the desserts!"

I highly recommend the dry laksa. The noodles is still al dante and full of flavors. The shrimp that comes with it is cooked to hold the laksa flavor until you bite into it. <br&gt;<br&gt;For dessert, their sugee cake is served warm. The flavor is classic and texture meant to melt in your mouth. If you have a special occasion to celebrate, Violet Oon is a great option for a sweet and fancy night. Was there to celebrate hubby&amp;#39;s birthday and they took a picture for us with a frame! Very classy! <br&gt;<br&gt;The service was impeccable. The staffs were always alert and knows their menu very well. We had leftovers of our beef rendang, which was the best meal of the night. Thought that they would throw it out but no, they called us to tell us we left it! So we went back to collect it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Oh, I almost forgot.

There are quite a few buses that pass this area so it is very convenient.<br&gt;<br&gt;Came here at around 11am on a Saturday morning - wasn&amp;#39;t as crowded as I thought it would be as I called in to reserve. Was eyeing on the Asian big breakfast (weekend brunch menu) the night before and ordered that, the pulled pork burrito and dry laksa.<br&gt;<br&gt;All I could say is that it is really delicious. The big Asian breakfast consist of yellow rice, two piece of chicken (wing and thigh), salad and egg balado (without chilli). I like the combination of spices and the spun around the food. It is a little on the pricey side though for a smaller portion. But worth a try.<br&gt;<br&gt;The pulled pork burrito was on the saltier side - not sure is it from the pulled pork itself or from the sour cream. The skin was not thick or thin, just right. <br&gt;<br&gt;Dry laksa - been eyeing it since I checked on the website. It is however not on the brunch menu so have to wait until 11.30 before I can order it. Taste wise it is like hokkien fried noodle but it has more spices and taste. There are prawns and sliced fish cakes in it as well as fried tofu. Yum!<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered ice peach tea as well. The peach was infused correctly and putting half a peach in the drink make the ice taste lesser. Make sure to ask the server for less ice.<br&gt;<br&gt;The atmosphere is interesting as it is an open concept but it&amp;#39;s at the shop houses.

Great fusion food that shows creativity AND an understanding of local flavors. Beyond the usual, highly boring and poorly executed dishes like eggs benedict, what passes as pancakes and french toast, Violet goes one step further and innovates by pulling Vietnamese pork and stuffing it in a breakfast burrito, grilling a panini with otak otak. You get the idea. Add to that the Perenakan classics that she&amp;#39;s known for, I can&amp;#39;t think of a better restaurant to recommend to friends who ask me for a modern &amp;#34;uniquely Singapore&amp;#34; restaurant, which until now I&amp;#39;ve been hard pressed to find.<br&gt;<br&gt;We had brunch on Saturday and tried the Vietnamese pulled pork burrito, corned beef hash and a side of potatoes. My burrito was ahmaaazing. Perfectly charred, sweet and tender thit nuong (think the lovely grilled pork you see on the streets of HCM served with vermicelli and fish sauce) stuffed with the usual fixins, accompanied by a simple tomato and avocado salsa. The side of potatoes weren&amp;#39;t as crisp as I would&amp;#39;ve liked but they were the greasy carbs one needs at 2pm on a Saturday. The dude thought his corn beef hash was pretty darn good too. We also ordered a lycee smoothie that was a little on the sweet side but refreshing. <br&gt;<br&gt;I have to admit I didn&amp;#39;t give the VOK 5 stars because I want to come back and try the Perenakan dishes before making that call. Service was very attentive and I was pleasantly surprised because my experience with chi chi brunch places hasn&amp;#39;t been the best. The decor at VOK is, to put it simply, reminiscent of P.S. Cafe and Pep pizza with old school white tiles, lots of black finishings, wooden chairs and dramatic floral arrangements on the bar counter. It&amp;#39;s not exactly original but I loved that the restaurant was chic yet cosy, unpretentious and they&amp;#39;ve got their food and service down right."

For me, the first time I&amp;#39;ve heard of her was actually a week back when I saw on Facebook a friend&amp;#39;s photo of a chalkboard menu, the signboard and a caption - &amp;#34;best meal of the year&amp;#34;.<br&gt;<br&gt;Of course I had to ask where. Apparently it is so new it wasn&amp;#39;t listed.<br&gt;<br&gt;And then I googled. So apparently she is Singapore&amp;#39;s Food Ambassador, Celebrity Chef, and apparently quite well-known by Singaporeans!<br&gt;<br&gt;Maybe she was the English version of &amp;#34;Fang Tai&amp;#34; that used to appear on Channel 8 cooking shows every day at 4pm.<br&gt;<br&gt;So of course I had to check it out. The place is just down from the 6th Avenue stretch and next to a Bar Bar place. First impression is that this place is very stylish. I really liked the decor, which reminds me quite strongly of P.S. Cafe&amp;#39;s.<br&gt;<br&gt;t was really crowded on the Saturday night that we were there. Filled with families who knew about this place via word of mouth, just like us? Every single table was occupied. No kidding. They also had a small space outdoors for alfresco.<br&gt;<br&gt;Looks like quite the plethora of choices! I was slightly stumped with it. The guy who attended our table (who looked like the son-in-law of Violet&amp;#39;s) was quite friendly and said our choice of the Beef Rendang ($22) was very good. And I ordered the Chicken Buah Keluak ($22).<br&gt;<br&gt;OK but so here&amp;#39;s the thing. We waited. and waited. and waited. In eager anticipation of the food. We also saw Mdm. Oon in the kitchen.<br&gt;<br&gt;But after 30 minutes, the food is still not here. We had checked on it with the staff 25 minutes in and they told us &amp;#34;5 more minutes&amp;#34;. Then finally, it arrived!<br&gt;<br&gt;So the Rendang was quite well-flavored and the gravy filled chock full with spices. But what we didn&amp;#39;t understand was how something like this which you scoop out from a pot will take 30 minutes. <br&gt;<br&gt;The beef was also made from the softer, almost jelly-like parts of the cow which my dining companion did not really liked. Though apparently it is quite common for rendangs to be prepared with that type of meat.<br&gt;<br&gt;I rather enjoyed my chicken buah keluak. On just an objective food level, yes the quality is there. Again, the magic lies in the gravy of the buah keluak. The chicken was a tad bony and dry though and barely had 3 substantial pieces. Salad was an afterthought. Rice was average.<br&gt;<br&gt;My problem with this beautiful dish is that it is up-classed Nonya food but the portions were tiny for the price of $22. I understand I am paying for everything else instead of just the food, but it just left me wanting a little bit more.<br&gt;<br&gt;Quite a nice touch however was when the same guy who attended our table came over after our food&amp;#39;s served to apologize for the long waiting time. He could have just ignored that fact, but acknowledged it instead which I felt made up for it a little.<br&gt;<br&gt;Perhaps it was that that made us go for the dessert - the sticky toffee date pudding with vanilla ice cream ($12). Wrong choice. The cake was really soft and sweet and had bits of dates inside, which did not add any flavor at all. The ice cream was average Wall&amp;#39;s/Nestle ice cream, no vanilla bean type. Marmalade Pantry&amp;#39;s Sticky Toffee Date pudding is much much better.<br&gt;<br&gt;Alright so I am at a dilemma as to what rating to give it. Thing is, the food is actually good for the main dishes. The service was actually quite attentive and friendly too. However, the price and the waiting time and the poor dessert makes me think twice about going back."

So it seems, even for a quiet weekday, the dining room was quickly filled with regulars and new faces. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was without a doubt great. I love the fact that the menu is well organized and a mix of fusion, seafood and meats. They also have a separate vegetarian menu and seems to be aware of certain allergies, which I thought was very well-thought off. Some traditional peranakan dishes have some twists with modern western influences. Mostly either a main with local herbs/chili flavors and accompanied with rice. <br&gt;<br&gt;I really enjoyed the wholesome flavors and sambal very much. The ambience is classy but cosy. It&amp;#39;s a place you can bring your family regardless of age as everyone will have something to eat and enjoy. There are also cocktails and lovely desserts if you plan to catch up with your girlfriends. My only complain is the expense my wallet has to endure.

As it was my first time as well as my friend&amp;#39;s, we had to ask the waiter and waitress for the recommended dishes. Foie Gras burger and the risotto was one of the recommended ones but since two of us are sharing the meal, I decided to go for Symmetry beef short ribs as the main dish and crispy baby squids and black pepper aioli as the appetizer. It was almost 8.30pm when we stepped into this cafe and we were pretty hungry. By just looking at the menu, we do not really know what to expect as some unfamiliar ingredients popped out from the menu. I was glad that the waiter and waitress were able to give similar recommendations which aided us to choose the dishes pretty quickly.<br&gt;<br&gt;As I continue to checkout the design of the restaurant, I also noticed that the menu we were holding were in symmetrical order as well (opening and closing). While waiting for the foods to arrive, more and more customers trickled in and we were asked whether we could switch tables and we gladly did (it was a better move as the next space was spacious). The orders started to come in a few minutes after our switch.<br&gt;<br&gt;The squids came first. It looked rather normal besides the black sauce next to it. I tried the squids without the sauce first and I could taste the crispiness from the flour of the squid. The squid itself was chewy. And adding it to the sauce it added more interesting taste to it. Light on the tastebud but the black pepper in it were pretty strong. Great combination.<br&gt;<br&gt;The beef ribs came next. The tenderness and juiciness from the beef were beyond words to describe. The fats were &amp;#34;melting in the mouth&amp;#34; according to my friend&amp;#39;s comment. The mashed potato on the dish were creamy and good mix with the edamame provided. Instead of a cafe kind of dish, I will consider this dish to be like fine dining&amp;#39;s.<br&gt;<br&gt;After clearing up what&amp;#39;s on the plates, one of the servers came over and checked with us whether we would like desserts to conclude the day. I was eyeing on the Hazelnut and chocolate Mille Feuille for awhile and since we are there, decided to give it a try. Like I mentioned earlier, I was clueless on what&amp;#39;s on the plate even though we were still holding the menu. For this dish, I like the chocolate ice cream and the crumbles beneath the ice cream. The others were not too satisfying for my taste palates (too bitter or too sweet).<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, the dishes here are very interesting. They even have brunch menu available on weekends and lunch menu on weekdays. One thing I have to minus a star is the pricing. 1 main + 1 appetizer + 1 dessert added up to around $85. Try out those recommended dishes and let me know what&amp;#39;s your inputs :) Bon Appetit!"

But I am not here for that. The food is apt for this place: it delivers high on presentation and very little on substance.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the &amp;#39;flan&amp;#39; which was anything but. A thin crust tray with slimey mushroom sauce, with 2 pork cheeks and an egg sitting in it. When asked if the food was ok, I said this wasn&amp;#39;t a flan and their explanation was a &amp;#39;deconstructed&amp;#39; flan. I don&amp;#39;t expect bar staff to go post-modernist on me. Surely the point of a deconstructed flan is that one is such a master of flans that one can improve upon it? Its not an excuse for not being able to make a decent flan - one that would send you back to the days when your culinary mum would have made for you after playing a game of football. It was also pointed out that the pork was tasteless and should have more flavor which was presented as feedback to the chef. But there was no attempt to satisfy the disappointed customer. Think it was around 23 dollars plus service charge plus tax for the Duchamp of dining."

Why have you fallen so far so fast? I remember when you first opened. I bounced in all wide-eyed and innocent, was seated promptly and fed delicious coffee and scrumptious food in a timely manner. I felt like this was a standout for Singapore&amp;#39;s crowded brunch/cafe scene. I felt like I&amp;#39;d discovered a new world full of wonder, magic and beauty.<br&gt;<br&gt;Fast forward 6-12 months and cynical business management and poor execution have sunk an otherwise promising business. It was Chinese New Year and Symmetry was one of the few places open. I&amp;#39;m not complaining, I still need places to go on public holidays. But when a restaurant remains open it&amp;#39;s a warning sign. It&amp;#39;s more difficult to get produce, there are less places open so crowding is a danger. But none of those things should be an excuse to provide a sub-standard service or product. Which on this occasion Symmetry most definitely did.<br&gt;<br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see. Configuration of the tables had changed to cram in more diners so we were cheek-by-jowl. I felt like I needed to execute a triple somersault to get from my table to the door and back. Not comfortable.<br&gt;<br&gt;Then it took 45 minutes to get two plates of moderately fancy eggs. We&amp;#39;re not talking about slow-roasted ox-cheek and duck confit here. Just some slightly fancy modifications on poached eggs, that&amp;#39;s all. <br&gt;<br&gt;Hey your kitchen can&amp;#39;t handle a full restaurant at lunchtime? That&amp;#39;s a problem for you. If you have 30 covers and you can&amp;#39;t feed 30 covers on a limited lunch menu with simple dishes then you shouldn&amp;#39;t have 30 covers. Maybe you shouldn&amp;#39;t be in business. Just sayin.<br&gt;<br&gt;So how&amp;#39;s about those poached eggs? They were frankly pretty terrible. I ordered the &amp;#34;sur le plat&amp;#34;. Hey everyone - don&amp;#39;t give your dish a fancy French name, it raises expectations. The sur le plat was like virgin sex: quick, uneventful and unsatisfying. It was subtle like beating someone over the head with a fire extinguisher. Maybe it gets the job done but it isn&amp;#39;t worth the effort.<br&gt;<br&gt;I was promised &amp;#34;artisanal bread&amp;#34; and good quality sausages. I got a crusty piece of butter-slathered cardboard and what tasted like supermarket-quality frankfurters chopped up and served lukewarm in a saucepan. And the eggs. Oh the eggs. How do you undercook poached eggs? You know those half-boiled eggs you eat with kaya toast? They have a very unique consistency somewhat reminiscent of what one might use for inseminating the *other* kind of egg. Y&amp;#39;all know what I&amp;#39;m talking about. <br&gt;<br&gt;And that&amp;#39;s fine. I love half-boiled eggs. But I ordered poached eggs.

I&amp;#39;m actually rather plebeian so subtle, nuanced eats and I don&amp;#39;t really click. Next, I view hipster/indie joints with a morbid fascination. On one hand, it&amp;#39;s revolting. I can&amp;#39;t cycle so I don&amp;#39;t see the allure of a bamboo bike. On the other hand, I quite like cement/brick walls and exposed pipes. <br&gt;<br&gt;Anyhow. You need reservations for this place. They write your name, time slot and number of pax on a rock so you know which table is yours, which is.. interesting because it looks like a bible verse. You know- Timothy 3:16 that kinda thing. <br&gt;<br&gt;Eggs are supposed to be done well here, so eggs it was. I had two eggs in a pepper puree sauce populated with an incredible amount of chopped sausage, while the other diner had eggs ben with maple glazed bacon. And because we were greedy, we had a cold cut platter to share too. And the eggs. Oh the runny eggs. My inner auntie frowns upon ordering a pair of eggs for $20 when you can get 10 for $2, but she&amp;#39;s easily placated with cold cuts. Which were ok, really. Smoked salmon, parma ham and some cured meat thing that came with blue cheese and another slab of even smellier cheese. I do love me some smelly cheese. The mains fared much better though, and the other diner was pretty happy with the nosh. As the day wore on (we were there at 11), the place was absolutely buzzing with activity, but happily we were free to just chill. <br&gt;<br&gt;On the downside, the place is really cramped. Every time someone walks behind me, I get bumped, which is all the time. You can&amp;#39;t really tell wait staff from diners, which can be a bit confusing since everyone&amp;#39;s wearing those tortoise shell rimmed spectacles, sporting a tattoo or turned up pants. And the price point is on the high side for a place located opposite a cemetery (cemetery. symmetry. is there a link?). Would I return? Well, yes, but only when it&amp;#39;s pay day."

It knows me inside out.<br&gt;<br&gt;Café by day, restaurant bar by night, Symmetry is a cosy and laid back spot in the Bugis area, situated within Jalan Kubor. The decor, the vibe and the music were all too familiar to me. We have the same great taste in music for the songs they played were all on my favorite playlist. ;) <br&gt;<br&gt;The lunch menu isn&amp;#39;t as extensive as the brunch one but the selection is still wide. I had to have my eggs regardless so it was the Poached Eggs for me. The waiter recommended this over the Croque Madame and i must say that i was very pleased with this.<br&gt;<br&gt;These were runny as though they were more soft boiled than poached. The creamed potato mash went nicely with the sunshine yolk. The spicy chorizo and caramelized shallots were amazing with the sweet and smoky flavors. Bacon was honey glazed but still maintained the saltiness. Oh and the blueberry butter cream was a nice touch to the entire dish. I really loved how the different flavors came together. <br&gt;<br&gt;The coffee tasted good but the foam wasn&amp;#39;t made well. As i was trying to get a good shot of the latte art, i noticed that my foam started to sink and bubbles started popping. Hmm... They took quite a while to get our coffee and it was only served after our mains have arrived. Something needs to be done about that.<br&gt;<br&gt;I will probably be back to try the other items on the brunch menu. They look too good to be passed over. See you guys there sometime!"

The end result is a balanced shot. <br&gt;<br&gt;Cappuccino - latte art, which is always a good sign - microbubbles give a smooth mouthfeel, but the underlying characteristics of the espresso were still present - they were muted but not eliminated. This was a combination of milk, foam and espresso that complemented each other.<br&gt;<br&gt;The shots are quite potent though, I definitely felt the effects afterwards. Symmetry is also home to a Slayer espresso machine, which can pack a double ristretto into each shot - if you are in any way sensitive to caffeine, please bear this in mind when ordering drinks!<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s slightly more expensive than other cafe&amp;#39;s, with an espresso and a cappuccino costing roughly $12, but the quality of coffee is good.

I had the symmetry eggs sur le plat.  It just had a little too much sausage and not enough flavor.  But the eggs ben was awesome as was the pork collar croissant.  They have a nice selection of beer and the prawn popcorn and bacon cheese balls were super tasty.  The staff were very nice and attentive.  They could give nice suggestions aside from the usual blank stare when you ask whats good.  The food came quick.  Everyone at brunch enjoyed it and I would recommend it easily.  I didnt feel the price was that bad. Its a little more than average but not any more than a place like PS Cafe and I find the food to be more interesting. I&amp;#39;ll be going back to check out dinner.

My bf and I decided to try this famous place for brunch.This place is really popular and I strongly suggest you make reservations prior to making a trip down.Symmetry Café is situated between Bugis and Lavender MRT station at 9 Jalan Kubor Road, opposite Santa Grand Hotel. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food is definitely good. We start off with Potato Fries with Truffle Oil Emulsion that had black truffle salt and Parmesan cheese evenly sprinkled, recommended for starter.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Big Breakfast- eggs of your choice, maple glazed bacon, smoked salmon, chicken cheese sausage, sauté mushroom, hashbrown, mesclun, berry butter and toast. Super satisfying, especially the scrambled eggs are so soft and moist. <br&gt;<br&gt;Tiger Prawn Aglio Olio - To be honest, we had better ones elsewhere, so this is neither yay nor nay. Prawns were succulent and fresh but paste will be better if its softer. <br&gt;<br&gt;Waffle - Mix berry compote, peanut butter, chocolate hazelnut, maple syrup, chantilly cream, blueberries ice cream. Warmly served waffle with its thick spread of peanut butter and blueberry ice cream/ small berries toppings made this dessert a divine indulgence! <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, we really like Symmetry. Decor in the cafe is a mixture of rustic and eclectic elements, food is very good, price is slighly on the high side but the quality of the food makes up for it. <br&gt;<br&gt;For full review and photos, you can find out more at <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eatandtravelwithus.com%2F2013%2F12%2Fbrunch-at-symmetry-cafe%2F&amp;amp;s=bd35c92b05365977f02a7e7ce400ea4f047862137486e3eb132d031f00e8ae13"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""&gt;eatandtravelwithus.com/2…</a&gt;"

And you have to squeeze to get to your table, to the washroom and also on the way out. This would probably be very acceptable if the food was good but this was not the case. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now on to the not so bad. I guess the pluses are that you can actually reserve a seat, the above average service and the cute woody decor of the cafe.

On one end people raved about their brunch &amp;amp; ambiance and on the other critics condemned their steep prices and mediocre food. After trying it for myself last night I see the merits of both sides&amp;#39; arguments.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Firstly, it does have a beautiful ambiance! We went there on a rainy night and it seemed almost as if you stepped into someone&amp;#39;s house. Someone with a good vintage/indie taste, of course. The contemporary art pieces mixed with the occasionally 1960s pin-up posters creates an atmosphere of old world meets new world. The wooden furniture and shelves contrasted against modern cutlery and crisp white plates. Even the toilets are candle lit and decorated with old books (for your reading pleasure). <br&gt;<br&gt;Now onto the food, the subject of much controversy. Yes, I agree most dishes are overpriced especially for a little hole in the wall on some unknown street. It is not exactly the city center but they are commanding city prices. Why? Because some of their food is really THAT GOOD. Mainly, the beef flank! It was heavenly! I bet many restaurants in the city could not even whip up beef half this good. It was truly amazing. Recently, I ate at Valentino&amp;#39;s, at turf city, arguably one of the best steaks I&amp;#39;ve tasted in Singapore at a whopping price tag of $288! Good beef don&amp;#39;t come cheap! Compared to the prices out there, Symmetry&amp;#39;s beef flank is a steal (though not in quantity)!!! I was pleasantly surprised that a humble little cafe could whip up such a delectable dish! I&amp;#39;ll definitely be back for more. Other than the beef flank, I heard that their Lamb shoulders ($49)  was highly recommended but one of my dinner companions did not take lamb so we passed on this dish. If it&amp;#39;s anything like the beef flank... I can&amp;#39;t wait to come back to try it (although I am not a big fan of lamb). <br&gt;<br&gt;To the critics&amp;#39; merit, the other dishes paled in comparison to the beef flank. Despite the cod and chicken both being very fresh (and the chicken surprisingly more tender than it looked), the style of cooking and sauces that accompanied them were quite average. Kudos to the chef for trying to spice up the chicken dish with truffle sauce but the combo didn&amp;#39;t hit it off with me. The chicken pan-fried was simply too blend for me and even though I love truffle sauce, it could not save the dish. The cod was average. Simple, Safe, Tried &amp;amp; tested. Nothing special. <br&gt;<br&gt;For desserts we had the milkshake and compressed baby carrots. The milkshake was rich and flavorful :) but at $9 a pop... I rather get mine from OnceAUponAMilkshake. A good attempt at trying to conjure up a new creation with carrots but unfortunately this dessert was disappointing. Served with a small scoop of what tasted like bread-pudding ice-cream and some crumbs of what we speculated were nuts, oatmeal, cookie crumbles and crust of carrot cake?  This was indeed a weird concoction as if the chef raided the fridge for last night&amp;#39;s left overs and toss it all together in a bowl. Last but not least... the carrots!!! They were served raw! it was so strange to munch on real, life-sized, baby carrots with ice-cream??? Not a good combination at all! Vegetables do not belong in my ice-cream :( <br&gt;<br&gt;Food Recap: 5 stars for the excellent beef flank &amp;amp; delightful ambiance - 2 stars for the mediocre other dishes. <br&gt;<br&gt;1. Cod $32 - OK<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Corn fed chicken $28 - OK<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Beef flank $38 - LOVE<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Strawberry milkshake $9 - LOVE<br&gt;<br&gt;5. Compress Baby Carrots $15 - Pass! <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, if you order the right dishes, don&amp;#39;t mind spending $50+++/pax on a cafe in an obscure location and enjoy a nice indie cafe this place can be a treasure for you."

I will hazard first that I am not a coffee drinker and can therefore only comment on the ambience, food and tap water.<br&gt;<br&gt;This Tully&amp;#39;s outlet is squashed in the same room as a Cold Stone and Quiznos, which means you won&amp;#39;t smell fresh roasted coffee beans as well as say Oriole Coffee. It has a somewhat utilitarian set-up in terms of furniture that lacks the warmth of Starbucks outlets, but there are cool outdoor rattan couches outside. The coffee I&amp;#39;m told is not bad at all but don&amp;#39;t take my word for it. <br&gt;<br&gt;I will hazard though that the cakes at Tully&amp;#39;s are horrible. While the stores in the U.S. source their baked goods from Schwartz Brothers or Raison D&amp;#39;Etre, Tully&amp;#39;s Singapore must have some sort of crappy central kitchen that supplies the same gunk to other over priced coffee shops. I&amp;#39;ve had the chocolate cake thing, the molten chocolate cake and I remember is that I didn&amp;#39;t finish the former and returned the latter (first the server served me a &amp;#34;molten&amp;#34; cake cold and when I asked her to warm it, she cooked it through in the microwave). So I would say go to Tully&amp;#39;s if you want half decent coffee but stay away from the darn cake shelf."

Infact the only reason why the coffee sells is because Tully&amp;#39;s is the only cafe around that area serving espresso based coffee. I have not tried the food but it does not look too appealing either. If you work around the area, I guess this is your only option for take away coffee so get used to it."

The coffee they serve is fresh and tastes a lot better than your typical Starbucks coffee. They even let you choose the type of coffee beans that you wish to have brewed so that each cup has its own unique flavour. I highly recommend this place to folks who are die-hard coffee lovers or even new coffee enthusiasts. The best part is that they change the type of coffee beans that are served everyday so that you will never get bored of the flavours. Other than the coffee, the ambience is great and really conducive for reading. I actually have a few quick meetings here and my friends and colleagues really appreciate the coffee that is served by Jewel Coffee. Hope to see more of these outlets opening up around the island. People need to know that there&amp;#39;s a bigger world of coffee flavours out there!"

The price was reasonable and the one catches more attention than the salami pizza was the smoked salmon pizza.<br&gt;<br&gt;Browsing through the section of cupcakes and crodos, found myself eyeing on the hazelnut Crodo (Christmas spun for the Crodo). Queued and gave the waitress my two food items that I wanted to try this time round.<br&gt;<br&gt;The pizza base was crispy and fluffy. Surprisingly it wasn&amp;#39;t too salty. I was looking for light bites and the pizza definitely satisfied my cravings. It was a little expensive but quality wise, it is worth the money spent. You can ask them to re-heat for you too.<br&gt;<br&gt;The hazelnut Crodo was interesting. It was decorated with thinned dark chocolate that looks like a nest. Inside was the hazelnut cream. The colored leaf like sugar toppings definitely brought colors to the dull Crodos. The hazelnut creme wasn&amp;#39;t too sweet. Not too thick either and it oozed out of the Crodo while cutting the dish into smaller bite portions. The dark chocolate helped to tone down the sweetness from the sugar sprinkles on top of the Crodo and the other sugary items inside.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service was pretty efficient here. The waitress cleared up my plate quickly after I emptied the two plates of dishes. This was the second time that I&amp;#39;m here for some light bites and desserts. Will definitely be back again ;) Cheers!!"

Not much indoor seating so you&amp;#39;ll have to like the outdoor type. I&amp;#39;ve been to another location in the mall but this is of course more better with a more cafe feeling right next to the botanical garden. The food is a good buy for the price. The hazelnut cake was surprising good. It looks so ordinary especially in the plastic to go container but the hazelnut inside was crispy and fresh so it was very nice. Espresso is above average. Not the best but very nice. I like this particular location.

Like any supermarket Da Paolo sells most of its items or antipasti by weight hence the price rockets if you&amp;#39;re not careful with your portions. Sadly for an Italian owned business, coffee is poor as well with a mighty upsetting bitter to sour taste. The only saving grace would be the Tiramisu but look out for some that have been sitting in the shelves for too long, the alcohol soaked layers may be dry and would definitely kill your joy.

The sandwich is made on-the-spot, and can be customized to your preferences. They are also usually quite generous with the salmon helpings, but the quality isn&amp;#39;t always consistent- there were times when the fish was limp and flaccid, and other times when it was over seasoned and hence too salty. Some might say that at $14++ per sandwich this standard is unacceptable- but I&amp;#39;m usually not too fussed because I think the ingredients and portion sufficiently justify the price. Very unusually, the veggies are in fact the star of the sandwich- they always come very fresh and crunchy. The vinaigrette dressing also elaborates the overall taste of the sandwich.<br&gt;<br&gt;On days when I decide to indulge, I head straight for the tiramisu. Their rendition is light and silky, allowing one to taste individually the chocolate, rum and expresso. The smallest portion is more than enough for 2- it is not cheap, but it is definitely worth it."

It always features in Singapore stop ice cream lists and now I know why. We went here after a long hike on the southern ridges and it was a well deserved a treat after the hike. They have quite a few flavors on offer we tried the rum and raisin and the rich dark chocolate ferrero. Both flavors have alcohol (rum in both cases) in it although it is more pronounced in the rum and raisin flavored ice cream. They have some other very interesting flavors like the gula melaka and earl gray lavender which I&amp;#39;m keen to try on my next visits!!

It also has a variety of salads to simple meals like meat pie. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their coffee is so-so but their selection of tea and juices are better than other places. I like to go there for their orange sunrise and their seasonal specials. I also like to go there for their chicken salad which is really quite filling and delicious. I have tried their meat pie.. it&amp;#39;s a bit small but the mashed potato on top of the minced meat really fills you up fast. It&amp;#39;s definitely not a place for men to go to as the food is definitely not enough for the guys but it&amp;#39;s great for ladies to go there and order a variety o their salads and meals and have a guilt-free conversation with their friends.

I recently visited Mean Bean and Wicked Grind, a cute little cafe tucked in a corner of the arcade next to Park Royal on Beach Road. The cute set up was opened by Kimberley, a fellow food blogger which is crazy about coffee and desserts like i am!<br&gt;<br&gt;The vintage and rustic hole in the wall outfit is small but cozy. Hang out by the bar counter affixed to the brick wall and enjoy a cupcake, tart or cake that is served on quaint little plates. Most of the items in the cafe are for sale too if you wish to take them home (wall lamps included!) Desserts are sourced from quality suppliers like The Little Yellow Apron, Kisses Bakery and All Good Things. The selection changes every couple of days so it&amp;#39;s always a surprise!   <br&gt;<br&gt;I absolutely adored the eclairs ($3 each) are from The Little Yellow Apron! The Vanilla eclair with roasted pecans was simply amazing. They are piped with a rich cream custard with lots of vanilla bean and then glazed with a milky white chocolate on the top. Other flavors include salted caramel, passion fruit and ispahan ($3.50).<br&gt;<br&gt;The tarts are also by LYA and are priced around $6 to $7. I loved the buttery crunchy crust of the tarts. Hot favorite was the Lemon Meringue Tart ($5.80) which had a lemon custard of the right acidity and sweetness. I&amp;#39;m not too much of a fan of the spongy meringue. My other favorite is the Sea salt Caramel Shortbread ($4.90) which is sticky chewy salty sweet! Super addictive i must say!<br&gt;<br&gt;Cupcakes ($3.50) are from Kisses Bakery and they have some really interesting flavors other than classics like Red Velvet (which was amazing). I rather enjoyed the Pineapple Tart cupcake which was refreshing and not as sweet as our regular CNY goodies. The Kaya cupcake was also very fragrant.<br&gt;<br&gt;Kimberly couldn&amp;#39;t stop stuffing us with more sweets and we tried more cakes from All Good Things. I&amp;#39;m not too much of a fan of the cakes though. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you need some savory bites, there are salads and sandwiches too and MBWG is also gonna add some brunch items soon! Coffee was pretty good too! MBWG is now open on weekends so you can get your sweet fix every day."

Play Nation is the perfect place for hours of good clean fun with friends and family. It is Singapore&amp;#39;s largest gaming cafe combining console games and board games. With a collection of over 200 board games and more than 100 Nintendo Wii and Xbox 360 games, there is something suitable to inject fun and laughter in family and group gatherings! On top of gaming, they also serve main courses as well as sides to go with your non stop gaming fun!<br&gt;Check out their private rooms, which mind you are not sound proof and you need to have 8 pax to book an entire private room. I visited on a weekend at 730pm. We were charged $14.90++ for 2 hours of gaming with free flow drinks and popcorn which were popped fresh and refilled constantly!<br&gt;I really really loved their popcorn, I think I grabbed 3 bowls of this from the tray warmer that keeps the popcorn fresh!<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Chicken Cutlet $10.90++ / $8.90++ (with purchase of a game package)<br&gt;The chicken cutlet tasted like every other fried chicken cutlet you&amp;#39;ve had at any hawker center. The chicken cutlet portion was pretty huge and I must say, Play Nation was also pretty generous with the fries.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Cheese Fries $4.90++<br&gt;This is my second time ordering cheese fries and if you have 4 pax playing console games, you get to pick a free side priced $4.90++ and below, and I usually go for this! The cheese is usually hot and the flavour of the cheese is pretty strong. The french fries don&amp;#39;t turn soggy at all and they&amp;#39;re not too heavily salted either.<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Pancakes $12.90++ / $10.90++ (with purchase of a game package)<br&gt;The pancakes didn&amp;#39;t taste that great, but their side dishes were more forgiving. If you were craving pancakes, you could most probably spend a couple of dollars more for pretty pancakes next door.<br&gt;The scrambled eggs were done right. They were fluffy and not too salty. The chicken sausages though, were over fried and all of them got stuck together.<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Chicken Chop $10.90++ / $8.90++ (with purchase of a game package)<br&gt;The chicken cutlet tasted pretty normal too, just like their chicken cutlet. I&amp;#39;m guessing they&amp;#39;re all commercially sourced. But if you do not like coleslaw, you can ask to get it swapped for more fries instead.<br&gt;We got to Play Nation at 730pm, ordered and were done with our meals by 830pm. The staff were very attentive and tried to help in any way possible. They have some of the most cheerful staff I&amp;#39;ve ever seen. 830pm, we started playing console games till 1030pm after which, we were told to leave or top-up for additional hours of console gaming.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall : 1) Quick service 2) Wallet-friendly meals 3) Do not expect too much for their food."

Probably passed by this street umpteen times but never noticed till it was a part of CYME. <br&gt;<br&gt;Came here at around 7pm and it was not crowded. People start trickling in towards 8pm to play the games that they offered.<br&gt;<br&gt;There are two floors to this cafe and it was quite easy to find where the stairs to the second floor is at. The interior design was simple but quite artsy I would say especially with characters that we have seen around and some of their own characters to represent the cafe. It was pretty neat interior design where it was a combination of simple yet there are some artistic works displayed on the walls, on the menu and on the display cases which is used to store baked goods (there are lego characters to brighten up a dull case).<br&gt;<br&gt;On one end of the 2nd floor there is a book case with many games and they were divided accordingly to the themes (small labelings on the book cases) and color coded so that you can return the board games accordingly. Pretty well-organized concept. But some of the games I have never heard of so the four of us went for Scrabble instead. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food wise, tried the crabmeat mentaiko pasta. Am in the pasta mood these few days. It was quite ok especially coming from a cafe concept dining. But the crabmeat was cold. Not sure why. The sauce was in a mix of roes and countable small scraps of seaweeds. The pasta was soft and easy to bite. For the price, if you do the boardgames package, it will be -$2 off your dish and comes with a free flow of ice lemon tea or ice peach tea. The peach tea tasted more like passionfruit tea and it came in a bigger glass so most people wouldn&amp;#39;t really care for the refills unless you are extremely thirsty.<br&gt;<br&gt;There is only one server serving the food dishes and doing the orders so sometimes it takes awhile before you can ask him to get more food or the bills. And due to the lack of manpower, I had to get the utensils on my own.<br&gt;<br&gt;On the website, it stated there is console games provided at this cafe too. No wonder there are Super Mario Bros and Sonic the hedgehog labels on the table. Overall, it is a nice place to chill at and play some board games with friends or colleagues :)"

There is a decent menu with things like fish and chips, chicken nuggets, and onion rings, along with drinks like coffee and beer. I settled for a beer, got the wifi password off the menu, and proceeded to work away. The staff played some pop and R&amp;amp;B hits from the early 2000s as background music, presumably to not make it feel so awkward. I appreciated the gesture, as it was a nice throwback! <br&gt;<br&gt;They offer a lot of value for money packages that are for 2-3 hours that include food, so definitely check it out if you&amp;#39;re interested in some good, clean fun.

Finally, there is a place where you can get to play all the board games you want without having to purchase any. I played the usual rounds of monopoly, boggle and finally a friend insisted on trying out settlers of catan. That was fun, really fun. It is a game where you try to win dominance over the area and strategise to block off your opponents. Okay, that didn&amp;#39;t sound quite thrilling but if you have a competitive streak, you will love it.

They have streamlined and refined their concept to continue bringing us gourmet and quality food recognised, with a greater emphasis on promoting healthy eating and lifestyle. <br&gt;<br&gt;The airy Dempsey outlet is pretty much the same. Other than housing Singapore&amp;#39;s first walk-in cheese room (with over 100 varieties), a large artisanal retail outfit, and bakery, jones has now added a brand new butcher&amp;#39;s corner by Swiss Butchery as well. Have a meal here and then bring another meal (or 2) home!<br&gt;<br&gt;We started with the Cheese &amp;amp; Charcuterie board (3 items $35, 5 items $45, 7 items $55, additional items $8). This is served with truffle honey, jones olive oils, jones Egyptian dukkah and a selection of jones artisanal bread. I can&amp;#39;t go on about how good the Stilton Blue was with the truffle honey. UMAMI. I would also add the smoked duck breast and some other cured meats to the mix.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not sure what to pair your cheeses with, don&amp;#39;t fret. The on-site cheese experts would help you with that. There are also suggested accompaniments placed together with the different types of cheeses on the shelves so you can always pick them out yourself. <br&gt;<br&gt;A starter that is the equivalent of a main course is the Oriental Crispy Duck ($26) which is a pan fried duck confit served on a bed of mesclun salad tossed with shimeji mushroom, Russet potato, cherry tomatoes, and tossed in a plum dressing. Somehow the salad stole the thunder from the duck, which was simply a protein accompaniment that is rather characterless. <br&gt;<br&gt;jones Classic Wagyu Burger With Truffle Fries ($26) is the bomb. Resistance is futile. How can anyone say no to this juicy 120g 100% Australian wagyu beef patty with crispy bacon?! Of course, the various condiments layer on the flavors perfectly- melted gruyere cheese, truffle mayo, bois boudran sauce, pickles, hot English mustard, and caramelized onions. They even make their own fluffy brioche bun which held the stack perfectly. I also had to tell them to take away the fries, if not i would not be able to taste the rest of the food with my limited stomach space. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Asparagus Risotto ($24) was a creamy soft herb risotto with fresh asparagus, Taleggio and rana padano with black truffle oil. Expect this to be very very filling. I couldn&amp;#39;t take more than 3 spoonfuls of this as it was rather cheesy, though bland. <br&gt;<br&gt;An enjoyable pasta was the Spicy Seafood Aglio Olio ($28), which was piquant and full of garlic. This dry pasta could do with a larger variety of seafood actually as it was mostly prawns (not that i mind but it did say that it&amp;#39;s a seafood pasta). I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind finishing a plate of this actually, but i thought the prawns were too powdery.<br&gt;<br&gt;Grilled BBQ Chicken ($26) was succulent and juicy, though pretty standard. The BBQ sauce had a nice hint of apple, which i thought was rather refreshing. That creamy and buttery garlic mash and minty coleslaw were kinda heavy for the dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;So i have found the best Warm Sticky Date Pudding ($15) in Singapore. Seriously this cake was buttery and moist and that salted caramel sauce was the bomb, especially with that rich vanilla bean ice cream. Any dessert after this just couldn&amp;#39;t compare. <br&gt;<br&gt;Of course, if you&amp;#39;re looking for something small, the freshly baked breads, pastries, and cakes would satisfy your tastebuds. All jones breads are organic and they only use premium ingredients here. <br&gt;<br&gt;So yes, welcome back, jones the grocer now!"

After hopping off the bus and walking allllll the way up Dempsey Hill, I decided to reward myself by indulging in lunch at Jones. (Okay, walking up Dempsey Hill wasn&amp;#39;t that bad, but come on, I should get some recognition for not driving or taking a cab out here!)<br&gt; <br&gt;I ordered the leg ham and gruyere cheese sandwich, with zucchini, tomato chutney, and apples. Sounds different and amazing, right?! <br&gt;<br&gt;Well, I was slightly disappointed. I found the sandwich to be a bit small and overpriced. I felt the ham just tasted like ham, the gruyere just like regular cheese, the tomato chutney was sweet but that&amp;#39;s it, and the zucchini and apple portion was lacking. Basically, nothing really stood out and the flavors didn&amp;#39;t seem to combine well. It was served with a small salad on the side, but I wish it had dressing on it. I did like the bread, as it was toasted perfectly.<br&gt;<br&gt;After paying my check, I decided to look at some of their grocery items. I love how they had a lot of Italian goods like bottled tomato sauces and dried pastas - I&amp;#39;ve been striking out on finding good Italian restaurants here so I&amp;#39;m always looking for quality ingredients to make my own Italian meals. The cheese room looked amazing but I was a bit intimidated by it. I also loved all the exotic teas they offered.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, so-so experience at the cafe, but totally loving their merchandise. This seems like the place to be on the weekends, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if I ended up here again. Looking forward to my next visit!"

The cold cuts and seafood are extremely fresh best eaten when paired with something from their extensive cheese cellar.<br&gt;<br&gt;Their range of products is extremely diverse &amp;amp; unique although sometimes a bit over priced.

So I got some <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeal.com.sg&amp;amp;s=179d9979ded3c26c41f9c891a3169b4be112313358c499de6ab81f8464a88b91"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""&gt;deal.com.sg</a&gt; vouchers and got 4 other friends to check it out.<br&gt;Here is the store front, it&amp;#39;s at the edge of Arab street, I walked about 5 minutes from Bugis MRT Exit D (Downtown line)<br&gt;<br&gt;Once you enter the shop, you will see the bar and front counter, sadly all those sandwiches up on the chalkboard were not available for dinner. I was so looking forward to trying the fully sick sandwich. I guess I have to come back here during lunch time then!<br&gt;So here is their 2 page dinner menu. It is not a lot of items, but it is good, as you don&amp;#39;t have to waste too much time picking items. As a group of 5 we decided to pick a bunch of appetizers<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Cracker Squid ($13)<br&gt;The squid was okay, the batter could be crispier, the tartar sauce was okay. The dish looked presentable, but it just didn&amp;#39;t taste as good as I had hoped it to be.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Squid Taco, Pulled Pork Taco, Fish Taco ($8 each)<br&gt;For the pulled pork, that was apparently cooked for 12 hours, it tastes not too bad. Generally pulled pork is very sweet and this wasn&amp;#39;t too sweet. I only wish the taco was the crispy corn kind, rather than the flat bread kind. This had me missing my Doritos Tacos for 99 cents in the US!<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Lotus Root Croquettes ($12)<br&gt;I decided to order this as I found this to be interesting, instead of one lotus root, it was all mashed up and shredded up. Pretty much like a mashed sweet potato breaded and fried. I found it a bit strange. The cilantro dip was not too bad, I liked the spices and it added some flavour to the sweetness of the lotus root.<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Truffle Hot Chips ($8)<br&gt;Pretty decent truffle chips, you could definitely smell and taste the truffle oil. My friends even commented that it might be better than Habitat&amp;#39;s truffle fries! A pretty good compliment if I might say so myself. They are generous with the fries for just $8 nett. 5 of us each had a good share of it!<br&gt;<br&gt;Main Courses :<br&gt;1. Steak Out ($18)<br&gt;I saw a comment on facebook that their steak was juicy and tender and decided to give it a try. We ordered it Medium and it did come Medium! Hurray! for cooks who know what they are doing! The steak was indeed juicy, tender and not dry! I enjoyed it thoroughly. I would definitely order it again if I was here for dinner.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Pork Yakitori ($15)<br&gt;For $15, I think this dish is overpriced, unlike the japanese yakitori, this did not taste like it had the yakitori sauce/teriyaki sauce on it. It reminded me of the halal kebabs, not sure why. The potato salad on the side though, was amazing! It tasted like a egg/carrot/potato salad? I am not exactly sure what ingredients went into it, but it was more amazing than the yakitori itself. The yakitori was okay, it was juicy, tender, it was abit hard getting the meat off the stick, but at least the meat wasn&amp;#39;t dry.<br&gt;Desserts :<br&gt;1. Brownie ($6)<br&gt;Apparently one of their best sellers, this brownie looked very humble, but once you dig your dessert spoon into it, you realize that it is very dense. Unlike most brownies that you would eat and feel gerlat, &amp;#34;heaty&amp;#34;, or feel like you&amp;#39;re about to get a sore throat the next morning. This brownie gives you that same sensation but not to that extreme. I feel that it would be well paired up with the SegaFreddo, but not at $10 more.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. SegaFreddo ($10) - Brandy Hazelnut Gelato<br&gt;The cheerful waitress recommended us to try this Brandy infused, hazelnut gelato. There were indeed alot of whole hazelnuts in this Gelato, but I could hardly taste the Brandy. Even though the waiter who served it to us, asked us to eat it with caution, as if we would be completely tipsy from eating the dessert. It was a nice dessert, but definitely not worth $10. <br&gt;We spent a total of $125 for 5 people, with the deal vouchers. <br&gt;It was a worthy dining experience. The shop itself seats at very most 15 pax, I hope they would consider serving the sandwiches during dinner, as I believe it would attract more customers.<br&gt;<br&gt;The service was good and throughout the 2 hours that we were there, the nice Indian lady asked us several times if we needed service, water top up, or any food recommendations as she knew that we were looking for ways to spend the $125."

Instead, I received a blueberry smoothie without the banana because the kitchen had none in stock. I wasn&amp;#39;t even given a choice to decline or change my order, rather it was served to me expecting me to just take it.

Whatever it was, it was not honey. It tasted more like evaporated milk but whatever, it was still sweet. The bacon was 7 dollars and I got 3 generous strips.

The salomon lasagna was very good (surprisingly so, was not expecting to like a seafood lasagna!) but much heavier than expected. I&amp;#39;m used to lasagna having tomato sauce within the layers, but the sauce with these lasagna is more of a cheesy cream sauce. Good, but heavy.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pizzas -<br&gt;Smoked salmon pizza was delish. The veggie was okay, but the veggies seemed a bit off (over cooked? dried out? just been sitting out all day?). The mushroom pizza was fab, but I&amp;#39;m also a big mushroom fan so others may not agree.<br&gt;<br&gt;In the deli case the broccoli had a bit too much oil (must have been a heavily oily stir fry), and wasn&amp;#39;t at all spicy (though labeled &amp;#34;spicy broccoli&amp;#34;).

The coffee here is actually really good, they serve excellent filter coffee and the ice coffee is also one of the better ones I have had in Singapore.

Service has always been very friendly here and I can see that as a regular you tend to get certain benefits as I have noticed that when I have been here a lot during periods (when I stayed close by) they always manage to find a seat and also sometimes give some free tasters of some coffee.<br&gt;<br&gt;I can agree with Michelle M that the bathroom set-up is a bit strange but that seems to be the same for several places around there but I never had any issues with it being overly dirty or messy - maybe it is for once the ladies room that looks worse than the men&amp;#39;s room :-)"

This place wasn&amp;#39;t all that bad, and the Brooklyn Style that I had was pretty nice. They also made a decent coffee (not that I am a real coffee connoisseur, but I decided that since I was overseas I would try out the coffee in as many places as possible). The service was pretty good, though not the quickest (but I found that that was the case in most places in Singapore anyway - maybe it is not as hustle and bustle as I am used to in Melbourne). It&amp;#39;s also a pretty quite part of the city as well, and the riverside view makes it great for the experience."

How on earth did they make it so flaky and crispy??? Magic. The scramble eggs were pretty good but then again how wrong can one go with them. Child&amp;#39;s play. The honey bacon on the other hand had an interesting smokey flavor laced with a sweetness that reminded me of candy bacon (Epic Meal Time). It was ok I guess but I think I prefer my bacon savory rather than sweet. <br&gt;<br&gt;Lovely ambiance <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s like walking into a cafe in Australia - Chilled, laid back and with a big coffee roaster.  I would love to bring a good book here one day, read it while sipping on my latte and nibbling on those magically croissants! <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall great experience. Perfect for a lazy weekend brunch. Best thing is that they serve brunch till 5pm so for all ya sleepy heads out there who cannot get up in time for a MacD&amp;#39;s breakfast, this is perfect."

Shall try that some time soon. Love the old warehouse feel to the area. Very grunge but they have since refurbished and repainted the exterior. We have noted this place some time ago before Toby moved in. <br&gt;<br&gt;Something we noticed about the recent development in the cafe scene is that they all kinda have the same decor. Brick walls juxtaposed with a black, white and wood theme. A little raw, a little unfinished. I&amp;#39;m not complaining because i like it this way. The flooring of my future home would be cement or i would have a cement wall feature.<br&gt;<br&gt;Nice airy space to chill at but my main complain is that there are not enough seats in the house! The concept of communal dining is cool but it&amp;#39;s not very comfortable squeezing between different groups of people early in the morning just to get my caffeine fix. The space could be better utilized i feel.<br&gt;<br&gt;The coffee is easy on the palate. I usually don&amp;#39;t take coffee without sugar but after having Papa Pahleta&amp;#39;s, i concluded that good coffee doesn&amp;#39;t require any additional sweetening. I would put this in the same category. Can&amp;#39;t say too much about the coffee as my throat was crying for help from the soreness and i think coffee made it worse. :(<br&gt;<br&gt;Ham and Cheese Croissant was really good. The pastry is very light and airy and extremely crispy! I would love for the centre texture to have more pull though. The pastries are outsourced. S said something about it coming from Bread Project. I should just go straight to the source to get my croissant. <br&gt;<br&gt;S had the poached egg with salmon on brioche. My first impression is that it looks a lot like WH&amp;#39;s but the brioche is not toasted and this is more buttery and very fluffy. Shall try the brioche with jam next time to get a more accurate feel to the texture. <br&gt;<br&gt;Nicely done eggs but i wouldn&amp;#39;t say that this dish is spectacular? Not something i would definitely come back for.<br&gt;<br&gt;W showed up at Toby&amp;#39;s after we were about done with our breakfast. He had the Toby&amp;#39;s Breakfast- a composition of scrambled eggs, back bacon, roasted tomatoes and peppers and sautéed mushrooms. The eggs sure look runny enough. Shall try this when i feel better. Anyway, it&amp;#39;s breakfast till 3pm daily so more incentives to come down. Downside to this place is also the really slow service. They really need to work on getting the coffee and food out faster."

Hailing from Australia, this franchise was a sign that our coffee scene is now big enough to sustain an overseas franchise since the Second Wave coffees. <br&gt;<br&gt;What it brought along was a huge space along the Robertson Quay area. It has very high ceilings and a very casual friendly atmosphere. What I really liked was the fact that they are really serious about the coffees. You can tell with the bean bags and apparatuses lying around. They bring in their own beans and there are sampler sets for you to try.<br&gt;<br&gt;The baristas are also very friendly and will speak to you about the coffee if you asked. When we went they have already ran out of food. Generally, try to avoid cafes on Sunday late afternoons if you want food!"

You can tell that most of the patrons here live around the corner, because they all look nice and put together. There were not enough people that looked like a frikken HOT MESS because they miscalculated how far it is from Clarke Quay and walked a good 20 minutes under the brutal sun right after lunch time. (I may or may not be talking about myself....) If it&amp;#39;s your first time visiting and you cab it, note that Rodyk St kind of dead ends and looks pretty residential. Keep walking towards Robertson Quay, hang a right and you&amp;#39;re there! <br&gt;<br&gt;The first time I stopped by, I ordered a cappuccino and a pastry. I admired the excellent latte art; the pastry was nothing to Yelp about. The second time I visited, I ordered the iced chai latte, and that was an epic fail whale. I kid you not, it was 10% chai at the bottom, 90% milk, and a tall cup full of ice, all for the lovely price of $6. Blech.<br&gt;<br&gt;I also find it strange how they don&amp;#39;t have a bathroom inside the shop. You have to go outside around the corner. I actually went to this bathroom, and it explicitly says it&amp;#39;s not a public bathroom but only for the residents of the building. Weird. Despite the warning signs, I used it anyways and unfortunately discovered that it needs some maintenance. There were only 2 stalls, and neither of them locked correctly. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, decent place to check out if you need to get out of your bubble. Just beware of the bathrooms."
