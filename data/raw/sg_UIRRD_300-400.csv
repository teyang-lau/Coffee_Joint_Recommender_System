Even on the weekends!<br&gt;<br&gt;The food is a little on the pricey side, but solid and though thier coffee lacks flavor, it does give you that caffeine kick! They also have a nifty thing where you can print an image in the foam! Only in one color though. <br&gt;<br&gt;The music isn&amp;#39;t very loud and the crowd here is usually very chill and quiet. There are plenty of places to sit and some have power outlets to do work in. <br&gt;<br&gt;The space is fairly clean and the large windows bring lots of light into the cafe without it scorching your skin! I can&amp;#39;t say anything about the desserts, as I havent had any of them yet!<br&gt;<br&gt;Though the staff members are friendly, they don&amp;#39;t seem to be on top of everything. The bathrooms are not checked regularly and the tables take hours to get cleaned up- even of there are little to no patrons currently in the store. The staff members are relatively young, which I understand, but I think they may need to work on just maintaining the space at a more accurate timetable is all.<br&gt; Also, whenever I&amp;#39;d ask for recommendations, the employees would always be unsure or try to upsell me the most expensive items which feels disingenuous.<br&gt;<br&gt;They also have messed up an order of mine, and though I was fine with it, they didnt seem very apologetic in the least. That left me wondering if they really had any customer experience.<br&gt;<br&gt;The cafe is connected to a hotel and if you let them know and show your room card, they give you 10% off your order.<br&gt;<br&gt;Mostly a good place to work, since all the cafes around seem to be more of a social spot- with a small maintainence and employee issues. <br&gt;<br&gt; But overall a solid 4 stars for me!"

Aside from the prime location in the heart of orchard road, what I like about this outlet is the laidback atmosphere of the cafe. Further, there are powerplugs freely available under the wooden tables both inside and outside. Aside from that, the long wooden table on the outside is perfect for group discussions. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re feeling bored, sit by the ledge, and you can people-watch. There are many interesting characters around this part of town, where the infamous Orchard Towers is located at. Time passes by very quickly at this Starbucks outlet.

I&amp;#39;m not very particular about it; of course I wouldn&amp;#39;t say McDonald&amp;#39;s, Starbucks, and Nylon coffee are all the same, but if you were to press me about the differences it&amp;#39;d be a bit difficult for me to say what they are!*<br&gt;<br&gt;That being said, I was looking for an air conditioned cafe in Tanglin that had free wifi, but didn&amp;#39;t have any luck finding something &amp;#34;Yelpy&amp;#34;. Not wanting to waste time, I decided to just visit the man and stop by this Starbucks in Delfi Orchard.<br&gt;<br&gt;As other reviewers have said, this outlet is in a prime location on Orchard Road. Not only do they have a spacious air conditioned interior, but they also have a nice covered patio if you&amp;#39;d like to be outside. But what makes this outdoor area better than Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf across the road is that 3 sides of the patio are enclosed in glass so there are less chances of pigeons flocking on the tables.<br&gt;<br&gt;Since they jump the gun here and start holiday season in October, I enjoyed sipping a peppermint mocha while mooching off the free wifi and getting some WERK done. Wifi expires every 30 minutes, so just be prepared to reconnect each time. <br&gt;<br&gt;My only complaint is that no one seems to bus tables here. When I arrived mid-day there were so many plates and dirty tables, and for the 1.5 hours I was there, not one employee went out to clean anything until I was about to leave.<br&gt;<br&gt;--<br&gt;*Judge me.

We enjoyed the Manzo Black Angus Marinato salad which features marinated Black Angus beef with pine nuts, rocket and pecorino cheese, drizzled with a delectable honey balsamic.<br&gt;<br&gt;Canestrato Pugliese e Pomelo was a refreshing mesclun salad with black olives, canestrato cheese, white balsamic dressing with fresh pomelo wedges for a citrusy tang; <br&gt;<br&gt;The pastas are made fresh at the restaurant and you can pick from one of the 18 different flavors; and there are also egg-, dairy- and gluten-free pastas as well! New highlights include Spaghetti Al Nero Di Seppia, Scampi E Datterini, homemade squid ink pasta flavoured with rich scampi sauce and cherry tomatoes with a hint of chili for added spice. I enjoyed the garlic seafood sauce but the pasta was a tad overcooked imo. <br&gt;<br&gt;For mains, The Baked Pink Snapper was delicious. I loved the sweet firm flesh with a nice golden crust all around and that pretty herbed mashed potato lightly tinted pink with beetroot juice. The caveman sort can go for the Slow-cooked Lamb with verbena-scented celeriac root puree, and Bistecca Alla Fiorentina with rosemary oil accompanied with baked potatoes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Other than the refreshed dessert selection which includes cakes and cookies, there&amp;#39;s also a gelato section by Alfero Gelato! Love love love their super intense gelato. You must certainly have the nutty Pistachio, salty sweet Coconut Sorbet, nutty Bacio, and more. There&amp;#39;s a special Waterfall flavor that is specially created by Alfero. <br&gt;<br&gt;A la carte dishes at The Waterfall are priced from $14. Expect other Italian favorites of cured meats and artisanal cheeses, as well as handmade pizzas!"

The Southern Italian fare is excellent; hearty and soulful yet refined. Although the restaurant was a full-house at the revisit, service was surprisingly efficient and gracious.<br&gt;<br&gt;We had:<br&gt;<br&gt;1) Spaghetti alla Chitarra con Ragu di Crostacei ($29) - homemade chitarra pasta laced with shrimp and tossed with garlic, chilli, and extra virgin olive oil, and lemon: it&amp;#39;s very saucy, but that&amp;#39;s the best part, aside from the swimmingly fresh prawns and perfectly al dente pasta. So good, you&amp;#39;ll ask for a spoon to wipe this clean off. <br&gt;<br&gt;2) Spigola all&amp;#39;Acqua Pazza ($36) - Neapolitan-style seabass served with cherry tomatoes, olives, and capers, in a white wine sauce: exquisite and delicate. I only wished they&amp;#39;d drown this in more of that white wined broth, it was that outstanding.<br&gt;<br&gt;3) Agello Arrosto con Timo e Patate ($36) - roasted lamb rack flavoured with thyme and served with new potatoes and sauteed vegetables: the husband thought it was lusciously cooked, and robust in flavour, I thought it was too full-bodied.<br&gt;<br&gt;4) Sharing Dessert ($32): great sampler of their greatest hits. In descending order of preference, I liked the Tiramisu, Ricotta cheesecake, Biancomangiare, and Profiteroles"

Today, I brought my sista to make a discovery on their less-known breakfast menu. Naturally, only in-house guests will pop by for a breakfast but we drove our way there intentionally.<br&gt;<br&gt;With a third of the menu presented with egg dishes, I was coaxed into having an egg white omelette by Kelvin who succeeded in uplifting my energy level with a light touch. I would think that the egg Benedicts make a good classic morning dish for most but you could opt for a more refreshing plate with a negligible 17 calories (approx) in each absolute white. I liked the finished egg with a soft curdy interior loaded with confetti mushrooms, fresh tomato dices and a handful of baby spinach. The 2 egg whites melded to form a very consistent texture and fastened with gold trimming that crisped in each mouthful. The opaque mass is made lighter with a less noticeable seasoning. If the notion of a perfect omelette is a moist and tender yield, then this came close except for some traces of slight weeping. Not to worry about the empty spaces in your stomach, it can be easily filled with the accompanying sautéed mushroom, a few baked potato wedges, some green salads tossed in vinaigrette; along with 2 crusty toast.<br&gt;<br&gt;For a more elegant egg dish, ask for eggs in varied Cocotte version; Chorizo, Mushroom or Roast chicken that comes with toast as well.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you are game for a eggless morning ritual, then the Pancakes and Waffles make good options, other than Asian selection - Chinese rice congee and Nasi Lemak. Here, I am trying out Buckwheat waffles. Instead of chowing down nothing but a few traditional buttermilk pancakes, these rustic-looking girdle cake not only serves for healthier option but a new wholesome taste. As we know, buckwheat contains no gluten and so it can be quite tacky when buckwheat flour is called for in a recipe. Without ruining the dish, this old-fashioned recipe has evolved into a fashionable fare with crispier outside and a more complex texture. I fear having that intense earthy after-taste often found in the Japanese buckwheat soba, this one was more easy-going. Rather than an airy dough, the buckwheat cake makes a coarse statement with a dense texture. One may frowned at its dull appearance, but the caramelised banana and a swirl of gula melaka make it a toothsome dish. Don&amp;#39;t pass up the opportunity to have one."

Was pretty crowded and it took awhile before tables for 7 was set up at one of the corners of the store. Most of the seating arrangements are indoors but there are a few tables and chairs on the outside of the storefront.<br&gt;<br&gt;Tried sampling a few flavors of the handmade ice creams - Straciatella, strawberry cheesecake, smurf and matcha. Decided to get a scoop of matcha as it was pretty addictive after it melted in the mouth. This is one of the best matcha ice creams I&amp;#39;ve tasted so far. Tasted more like the authentic matcha beverages. It is light in taste but had lingering impact just after a small bite. Some of my friends tried the salted caramel and rum and raisin.<br&gt;<br&gt;The space was pretty compact. Not so suitable for more than 10 people as you might need to wait for awhile before they connect the tables together. The staffs are pretty friendly and they don&amp;#39;t mind letting us try the different flavors they had on that day. <br&gt;<br&gt;Wanted to try the waffles too - in fact you can tell them how you want it made (crispy or softer). The homemade ice creams were definitely delicious. Will be back for more waffles and gelato soon :)"

Probably the biggest portion I have ever received just for sampling a flavour. My friend had the eye-catching blue-coloured smurf flavour and I had the nutty pistachio flavour. Half a waffle on its own costs $5 and a full waffle costs $8.80. When we ordered 2 half waffles, the waitress offered to let us split the full waffle in two plates instead. Good job in helping customers save money! The waffle was crunchy but not spectacular. Everything else though adds points and I recommend dropping by this charming place."

My friends and I had bad experiences at this outlet. The aunties at the counter are pretty hostile and arrogant. There was once my friend made a minor mistake in ordering because she mixed up the name of the drink and sugar level with the other one offered by another popular bubble tea chain, and was given condescending remarks.

The coffee here is exceptional. I tried the raspberry candy coffee, which surprisingly had the flavor of raspberry. I&amp;#39;ve never had anything quite like it.<br&gt;<br&gt;The baked egg was their supposed &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; and was pretty tasty, but not something I&amp;#39;d go out of my way for. It came with salmon and raw kale. If they had baked or fried the kale, that might have tied everything together.<br&gt;<br&gt;Love that they provide the wifi password right at the cash register. That&amp;#39;s what a good internet cafe should be like. The ambience was quite adorable with a cozy, cottage-like feel. Since you order first, it&amp;#39;s easy to split the bill with a big group. Prices were also quite reasonable, so no need to break the bank for brunch. If you arrive before noon, there&amp;#39;ll be plenty of seats on the two floors."

This was incredibly disappointing. The toast, while good quality, was tiny. And the worst bit, the portion of avocado was unacceptably small. Not even 1/8 of an avocado was provided - just three and a half (barely) Super thin tiny slivers of avo which I had to strategically spread out in order to get some in each bite. After eating I felt like I hadn&amp;#39;t even had breakfast.

Everything is sorta...average-ish. <br&gt;<br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start. First of all, it&amp;#39;s located in an old shophouse which generally is fun cos it adds to the ambience. However, methinks they never changed the electrical wirings because the first time I went, power tripped SIX times during my meal. In fact, the dishes were so underwhelming I thought I would never return. <br&gt;<br&gt;I only went back as a friend wanted to try. <br&gt;<br&gt;This time, I had a salted egg prawn eggs Benedict. Uneven dish. Prawns? YUMS. Poached eggs&amp;#39; yolks were sufficiently runny. But serving it on a slice of white bread?? Come on! And the salted egg could be saltier. <br&gt;<br&gt;My friends ordered a Big Breakfast. Honestly, the presentation was terrible. See photo attached. I think it was sufficiently yummy cos my friends finished it?<br&gt;<br&gt;Our dessert - turkey bacon pancakes - was the best. Pancakes were sufficiently fluffy yet slightly dense. Turkey bacon was nothing to scream about. And I think I enjoyed it simply because there was maple syrup. <br&gt;<br&gt;Its cheaper price point means they attract Uni students. Honestly, if you can afford a more expensive meal, please go there. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I don&amp;#39;t hate this place. I just think...it is very blah. Servers aren&amp;#39;t too friendly and importantly, the food is very uneven in terms of taste and quality. <br&gt;<br&gt;So. There are better cafes in the vicinity. Try Souper Sarnies."

Until now.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read the mixed reviews for this place but still decided to give it a chance. Innocent until proven guilty right? <br&gt;<br&gt;It was a really scorching day so for one, we were just happy that the air-conditioning was working very well.  <br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been to a few of the wedding shops across the street (as a best-men and not as a groom) and I know how temperamental some of these old converted buildings can get, trapping heat in the strangest of places. <br&gt;<br&gt;Not too much of a smell going on as there was barely anyone when we came. <br&gt;Staff were nice and friendly, offering a menu the second we stepped in. Only thing was, I wished she stood in front of the counter instead of behind it. More pleasant to the eye and easier for her too, not requiring to stretch across the counter to provide me a menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;Decided not to go into the many details of their coffee today but concentrate more on the food. <br&gt;<br&gt;Steak Sandwich<br&gt;One word. Awesome! Beef was done medium rare and was really juicy and tender, cheese was strong enough to add to the saltiness of the dish while the onions (and I don&amp;#39;t normally like raw onions) added a greater depth to the dish, giving it a bit of pungentness and cutting the richness making it more even and enjoyable. <br&gt;And at $8.00, it was worth every cent! Although I would have loved the option of a fried egg. What&amp;#39;s better than eggs and streak right? <br&gt;<br&gt;Salted Egg Yolk Eggs Benedict<br&gt;Now this was a pleasant surprise. Sitting on top of steamed buns (like those used it stewed pork buns or kong ba bao), and layered with vege, prawns, poached eggs and finally, a salted egg yolk sauce, this dish was true east meets west. The prawns were well seasoned and not over cooked, the eggs were perfectly runny and the salted egg added such a nice dimension to the dish that we were hoping we could have asked for more sauce! <br&gt;<br&gt;A wonderful take on an otherwise overdone and over promoted Eggs Benedict. <br&gt;<br&gt;Mandarin orange and pineapple cake <br&gt;And what better way to end the meal (we actually started the meal with this instead, but let&amp;#39;s pretend we ended with it since it&amp;#39;s a dessert) than with a generous slice of mandarin orange and pineapple cake. <br&gt;At a glance, it looked like a regular carrot cake with cream cheese topping but one bite would bring all the festivities and firecrackers of Chinese New Year bursting in your mouth! The mandarin orange is the star of the cake, with the slight acidity coming through. The pineapple (which was more of a pineapple tart paste than the fruit) adds a good amount of sweetness and tartness to the cake, elevating the flavours of the mandarin. A harmonious blend to welcome in the new year! <br&gt;<br&gt;Iced Chocolate. <br&gt;Now THIS is what a chocolate milk / ice chocolate should taste like. Unlike the bottled one from my previous post, this was a pretty good ice chocolate (my favourite still goes to the frozen chocolate drink from the now closed au Chocolat at Marina Bay Sands).<br&gt;<br&gt;Bottom line? Drury Lane knows what they&amp;#39;re doing and on my next trip, I&amp;#39;ll try their much raved coffees and Beef Ribs which I heard were amazing. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now to close my eyes and imagine that succulent steak sandwich."

We looked forward to this weekend brunch all week, and sadly, were quite disappointed.<br&gt;<br&gt;THE DRINKS<br&gt;I had an iced white, which was very cute and tasted nice. Had a good amount of caffeine, but not too much.<br&gt;<br&gt;THE FOOD - fusion-esque, but missing the synergy to make it work<br&gt;We were excited to try some awesome-sounding fusion dishes, but none of them hit the mark. Fusion is hard - it sounds exciting, but often the mix of different cultures, tastes, and techniques makes the food lose the appealing factors from its constituent bases. I think that&amp;#39;s what happened here. We tried the chili crab pasta with kale, topped with a poached egg. This was ok - the chili crab was a little sweet with the spaghetti. Spaghetti texture was nice, not too mushy. We also had the kale salad with red onions, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and quinoa, with a lemon vinaigrette. This was probably our favorite dish of the ones we tried, as it was the least fusion-y and most basic. The flavors were good and the ingredients were fresh enough. Finally, the infamous salted egg prawns eggs benedict served on a Chinese bao. This just was trying too hard. The bao didnt have the crunch that a traditional english muffin does, and therefore lacked texture to compliment the poached egg. The prawn and salted egg tastes were good, but got lost amongst the large bao and the poached egg. Overall, it was a pricy and unimpressive meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;THE WIFI<br&gt;Spotty at best."

There was no air conditioner, just a few fans and on a hot day like today, it was almost suffocating. I also found the place very dirty. While some have described this place as &amp;#34;chilled&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;laid back&amp;#34;, I&amp;#39;d say it lacks any soul. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered an iced white and an salted egg shrimp eggs benedict.

The shrimp still had shells on their tails but you wouldn&amp;#39;t know since they were smothered in the super bland salted egg &amp;#34;sauce&amp;#34;.

The cafe spans 2 storeys so head on upstairs to escape the oily food smells as cooking and brewing are all done in that little space. Oh but do note that you gotta come down to place your orders still. <br&gt;<br&gt;It was a terribly hot day and we headed up to level 2 as W had already gotten us a reservation. I was hoping for a cool reprieve from the crazy heat but there was none. The AC was super weak and hardly cooled the heated 2nd storey of the shophouse. It was obvious that they have issues with the power rating as well because we had 2 blackouts in the short span of an hour.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well brunch was meant to be a birthday gathering for Cliff and i felt so bad for suggesting Drury at that point. It was also impossible to hear each other because the acoustics were terrible. Throw in 20 other people and it&amp;#39;s just deafening. Not a good place for a date certainly.<br&gt;<br&gt;So i had the Iced Mocha because it was simply too hot to have a hot drink. The drink was pretty good imo with melted chocolate instead of bottled syrup and it didn&amp;#39;t overpower the mellow coffee. <br&gt;<br&gt;We had one of the specials which is the Garlic toast with sausage patties, sauteed mushrooms, spinach and truffle scrambled eggs ($18). This was the best savory dish out of the lot due to the garlic spread i guess. Scrambled eggs were too runny in my opinion and that sausage patty was just a joke with its bland flavor and dry nature. Eeks. For $18, it&amp;#39;s not quite worth it. I&amp;#39;ve just had the pulled duck with apricot croissant at Symmetry and it was way better than this at the same price.<br&gt;<br&gt;The sandwiches are at least decently priced at about $8 ish. The Steak and Cheese Sandwich was supposed to be awesome but they didn&amp;#39;t have that when we visited. The Smoked Salmon and Mushroom alternative were just alright.<br&gt;<br&gt;DO NOT EAT the Sausage Baked Eggs ($12) with spinach, homemade baked beans and cheese. We saw that familiar cardboardish sausage patty. Well this pot of food is terribly bland and pedestrian. I&amp;#39;m sure i make better stuff than this. I thought the baked beans were more canned than homemade though.  <br&gt;Maybe try the Cloud 9.4 which is bacon infused pancakes with honey if you please.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well, would i go back to Drury Lane? Not for the food certainly. But the desserts were quite divine. Not to sure about the &amp;#39;Pay as you wish&amp;#39; muffins but the Banana Bread with Espresso Butter ($2.50) had W and i takeaway a portion each.<br&gt;<br&gt;The moist bread with chunks of banana was naturally sweetened and i&amp;#39;m glad they didn&amp;#39;t add more sugar. The espresso butter wasn&amp;#39;t that good because it was oily (not the good kinda butter way) and lacked espresso flavor.<br&gt;The Carrot cake was also one of the best i&amp;#39;ve had as well. It&amp;#39;s of medium density but very well flavored with spice. We liked that there wasn&amp;#39;t too much cream cheese because they didn&amp;#39;t ice the sides but those between the layers were just sufficient for the added flavors and moisture.<br&gt;<br&gt;Verdict of Drury Lane- I may drop by again for the sweets and a quick drink but certainly not for the food."

Was around the Greenwood area and passed by this place so decided to give it a try during tea time.<br&gt;<br&gt;What &amp;#34;sparkled&amp;#34; me at my first look was the Chocolate Raspberry Cupcake. And while looking for other baked goods, chanced upon Raspberry macaroon. I then flipped the menu to get myself a beverage as well and ended up with Very Berry smoothie. Can find out more here: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bakerandcook.biz%2Fproducts.htm&amp;amp;s=430a80889a5cff7eacdcc39b67a0b72fbe76b5d853ff4eb76056f090f3e408fd"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""&gt;bakerandcook.biz/product…</a&gt; (list not fully updated - baked goods changed according to its availabilities).<br&gt;<br&gt;First off, ate the macaroon. It has a crunchy outer layer and the jam was not too sweet. Took 3 bites and poof, it was gone.<br&gt;<br&gt;Next up, chocolate raspberry cupcake. The cream was deli-sh. The cupcake itself was moist and not too sweet. Was thinking that it will be too much of chocolate in between the cupcake during purchase but ended up at the right amount. Sugar level wasn&amp;#39;t too high either for this cupcake. Glad that I got it!<br&gt;<br&gt;Very berry smoothie. Not too thick, not too runny. Perfect blend with right amount of fruits. Was a little on the pricier side but glad that I did try it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Customer service here was excellent. Staffs were friendly and smiling all throughout the transaction. They also repeated order in case they misheard the customers. When customers leave the cafe, they will clean up in a quick manner.<br&gt;<br&gt;After munching on my goodies, I decided to get a bagel back for the next day. It was onion bagel. Also saw the gingerbread cookies over the counter. Decided to grab that as well. <br&gt;<br&gt;Second day arrived. Tried my bagel - was pretty good without even heating it up after almost a day. Gingerbread cookies are not too sweet as well. <br&gt;<br&gt;Third visit - very berry donut and raspberry rage smoothie. The very berry donut has a berry taste at the top topped with fluffy donut texture and citrusy fillings. Great sweet and sour combination with an addition of mini malt balls on the top to make the dish crunchy. For the raspberry rage smoothie, more sour than sweet. Good for tea break.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, excellent cafe/bakery in town. Will be back for more smoothies &amp;amp; baked goods."

But the Chinese 5-spice Chocolate Macaron ($2.50) scores points for creativity but not for texture. <br&gt;<br&gt;Meantime, the Canele ($3) did not pass muster for the dry interior and one can find definitely spot better ones elsewhere.Similarly, the Milllefeuille ($5) was disappointing. The custard was too gluey and had an synthetic vanilla smell. The sheer amount of filling was too heavy for the wilted paper-thin puff pastry to handle. <br&gt;<br&gt;But it was not all too bad when it comes to the lemon tart ($5). In fact, it was the best, thanks to the buttery and crumbly pastry shell with occasions sparkles of salts. The creamy lemon interior had the right balance of tartness and sweetness.

The berries would simply burst when you sink your teeth into the bagel and act as a fresh jam to sweeten each bite.<br&gt;<br&gt;Sandwiches are available at $8.50 and what&amp;#39;s available is dependent on the Chef&amp;#39;s mood. There were only 2 options and that makes life a lot easier for indecisive eaters. Ham And Cheese Turkish Pide Sandwich ($8.50) was my choice for my Tinner (Tea+Dinner). The bread is tough on the outside, the toasted part is almost like a pizza crust and it crackles with each bite. However, it&amp;#39;s pillowy soft on the inside. Love the black sesame seeds on top. They added on a smoky dimension that is oh-so-fragrant. Eat it fast though. It really gets the jaw going when it&amp;#39;s colder.<br&gt;<br&gt;Z was raving about the quiche even before we got to the bakery. For $7.95, you get a slice of the pie with a salad of your choice. I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of vegetables but this is very fresh. The burst of colors of the fresh greens and reds really helped whet our appetites. The eggy centre was extremely moist and creamy. I&amp;#39;ve hit the Quiche jackpot! The pastry is not very crispy because it has absorbed all the essence of the fillings. <br&gt;<br&gt;Before leaving, i simply had to express my disappointment at missing out on the meat quiche (Only the Veg was available). A Quiche Lorraine would be oh-so-perfect. The Chef immediately went to check if there&amp;#39;s another pie for the next day and WALA! Wish granted! It always helps to look extremely sad and pouty. Heh. Anyway, it was equally moist, so it&amp;#39;s not purely the contribution of the vegetables.<br&gt;<br&gt;The wide array of colorful desserts were hard to resist. We started off with the lemon tart. I like the crumbly and buttery texture of the crust. The curd is a little more fluid and sticky and also leaning towards the sweet side. I would prefer it to be a tad more sour (it&amp;#39;s a lemon tart afterall!). In the end i emptied the golden cup of its content and focused on the tart while Z happily ate the curd. <br&gt;<br&gt;Had the mochaccino and it was a liquid chocolate-expresso fantasy. For $5.50, a huge mug of fragrant chocolatey dream is served. The texture is smooth and the foam was really thick and it held up the sugar for a really long time (i&amp;#39;m gonna start timing next time). Anyway, it&amp;#39;s almost like drinking hot chocolate but the sneaky caffeine gave me an energizer-bunny buzz for the rest of the night. This is like downing cocktails without realizing how strong the drinks are and then getting pretty drunk. Caffeine is my alcohol.<br&gt;<br&gt;The cakes look very yummy, especially the cheesecakes. They look especially moist and dense. Whole cakes go for about $23-25. <br&gt;<br&gt;Z doesn&amp;#39;t like cheesecake so we settled for the chocolate cake which was quite a disappointment. There is no denying that the texture was quite perfect- dense and thick. However, it seems to lack in the chocolate department, it just wasn&amp;#39;t rich enough. On the whole, it was pretty dry.<br&gt;<br&gt;Packed the shortbread home. Every mouthful was a cranberry explosion. Z thought it was too much as it&amp;#39;s hard to enjoy the true taste of the shortbread. I thought the shortbread was a little bland and the taste fell flat. Thankfully the cranberries revived it a little."

Thank God it was a rainy day and it was cool enough.<br&gt;<br&gt;They have a pretty strange rule that they stick by such that people sitting outdoors can only be served food in takeaway packages. It was quite a spoiler to receive my egg benedict in a cardboard box and $17++ seemed a little too much to pay for such a meal all of a sudden. The food was otherwise pretty good, eggs poached to perfection and a slightly spicy hollandaise sauce accompanied by toast and crisp back bacon. I had a flat white to go along and was pretty pleased with it. They do a pretty good cherry pie and raspberry tart too.<br&gt;<br&gt;I guess the main thing that pulled the overall experience at baker &amp;amp; cook down for me was the lack of indoor sitting and the fact that the food was served in cardboard boxes to customers seated outside.

I know how to grind beans and make coffee in a french press for my mum, I love the smell of coffee brewing and when it pops up in savory food and sweets...but I just hate the taste of coffee as a drink. No matter how much milk, sugar, nothing, best beans, kona beans, any beans, my man has tried to get me to drink it and the most I&amp;#39;ve tolerated is 2 sips. The one time I drank a caramel latte in Japan because I totally misread the menu, it was really sweet and suddenly I was talking non-stop for an hour. <br&gt;<br&gt;Since this IS a coffee joint, my dude has his two cents in this review. He had a decaf black and in his words &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s wonderful. very smooth&amp;#34;. So there.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now on to the food. We&amp;#39;re really brunch people so we were looking for food more than coffee. When I say I&amp;#39;m a brunch person it&amp;#39;s not because I like to dress up to eat a meal I can cook at home. I&amp;#39;m actually a hungry person, I like brunch foods and someone always wakes up too late to fire up the pan. Anyway, we had the french toast and a breakfast sandwich (can&amp;#39;t remember the exact name) and both were pretty good.  My french toast was made of 3 thick slices of brioche sliced up, drizzled with a caramel sauce with bananas and nuts drizzled over. It was beautiful to see and a hearty portion for my rumbling tummy. Here&amp;#39;s the problem: the egg wash wasn&amp;#39;t soaked through the bread. Whhhhhhhhy? It would&amp;#39;ve been perfect otherwise. If there&amp;#39;s a monkey jimmy listening - please soak the toast, turn the heat low and cook that baby.<br&gt;<br&gt;The breakfast sandwich was a standout. A generous, fluffy omelet sandwiched between avocado slices, ciabatta and a sweet-ish tomato chutney. It was brilliant, huge and I would eat it again. And again. So that&amp;#39;s a winner right there.<br&gt;<br&gt;What didn&amp;#39;t I like? The guys on shift probably partied until 4am and decided to bring their music to work. Bad trance music in a coffee shop is just wrong. Especially at 2pm on a Saturday. That gave me a headache and I shouldn&amp;#39;t be getting one at a place where there&amp;#39;s a toilet bowl watching me eat."

Anywhere in one north is almost exclusively catering for ex-pats and high-income locals. Jimmy Monkey is no different. Egg&amp;#39;s Benedict will run you a whopping $24, pancakes are $14, and the french toast is $17.<br&gt;<br&gt;They had run out of pancakes on a Sunday at noon so I went with the french toast, and added on a chocolate, peanut butter, speculoos shake for good measure. This was not a wallet-friendly brunch but I was happily surprised by how tasty everything was. The french toast comes in a healthy serving, and includes berries and crème fraîche. By the end I was actually struggling to finish my serving because everything was so sweet.<br&gt;<br&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be opposed to returning but this place is definitely a treat, and not a joint for regular meals. Seating is fairly limited, but somehow sufficient for the number of patrons. It gets a little warm, and the space does feel a little cramped.

This is not surprising - Jimmy Monkey&amp;#39;s Ironbark blend is a combination of beans from Brazil (Cerrado), Papua New Guinea (Sigri), Columbia (Kachru), Guatamala (La Laguna) and Peru (Amazonas). There is also a Columbian single origin blend available, which works well in pourover coffee. Each bean variety contributes something unique to the shot - hints of citrus, and even some chocolate notes. Ironbark is a blend that is still evolving, and is now on it&amp;#39;s third iteration. The experimentation has paid off, leaving a full bodied shot with a lingering aftertaste.<br&gt;<br&gt;The cappuccino that I ordered was notable for the initial strong hit of coffee flavour, complemented by smooth, light foam and finished with well executed latte art. The microbubbles in the foam add the smooth, silky mouthfeel that I look for, and is seen in quality cafes. This is where Ironbark is used to good effect - the lingering aftertaste is a strong base for a milk based drink, ensuring that the fundamental coffee character is retained.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had a Piccolo also, which is characterised by a more robust coffee taste, with the aftertaste lasting through the milk and foam. The milk complements the robust coffee flavour, smoothing it but not smothering it, creating a hybrid which retains the best characteristics of each - its just right and well executed. Their original place in the piccolo latte hall of fame post is deserved, and retained. There are also pourover, syphon and chemex coffees available. <br&gt;<br&gt;This is a good choice for anyone in the West of the island, and worth a quick trip on the MRT for coffee lovers elsewhere."

I know how to grind beans and make coffee in a french press for my mum, I love the smell of coffee brewing and when it pops up in savory food and sweets...but I just hate the taste of coffee as a drink. No matter how much milk, sugar, nothing, best beans, kona beans, any beans, my man has tried to get me to drink it and the most I&amp;#39;ve tolerated is 2 sips. The one time I drank a caramel latte in Japan because I totally misread the menu, it was really sweet and suddenly I was talking non-stop for an hour. <br&gt;<br&gt;Since this IS a coffee joint, my dude has his two cents in this review. He had a decaf black and in his words &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s wonderful. very smooth&amp;#34;. So there.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now on to the food. We&amp;#39;re really brunch people so we were looking for food more than coffee. When I say I&amp;#39;m a brunch person it&amp;#39;s not because I like to dress up to eat a meal I can cook at home. I&amp;#39;m actually a hungry person, I like brunch foods and someone always wakes up too late to fire up the pan. Anyway, we had the french toast and a breakfast sandwich (can&amp;#39;t remember the exact name) and both were pretty good.  My french toast was made of 3 thick slices of brioche sliced up, drizzled with a caramel sauce with bananas and nuts drizzled over. It was beautiful to see and a hearty portion for my rumbling tummy. Here&amp;#39;s the problem: the egg wash wasn&amp;#39;t soaked through the bread. Whhhhhhhhy? It would&amp;#39;ve been perfect otherwise. If there&amp;#39;s a monkey jimmy listening - please soak the toast, turn the heat low and cook that baby.<br&gt;<br&gt;The breakfast sandwich was a standout. A generous, fluffy omelet sandwiched between avocado slices, ciabatta and a sweet-ish tomato chutney. It was brilliant, huge and I would eat it again. And again. So that&amp;#39;s a winner right there.<br&gt;<br&gt;What didn&amp;#39;t I like? The guys on shift probably partied until 4am and decided to bring their music to work. Bad trance music in a coffee shop is just wrong. Especially at 2pm on a Saturday. That gave me a headache and I shouldn&amp;#39;t be getting one at a place where there&amp;#39;s a toilet bowl watching me eat."

Initially, I thought &amp;#34;Jimmy Monkey&amp;#34; was a supplier of coffee beans. To my surprise they are a cafe which roast their own beans (and hence name it after themselves)! A very hipster one in fact! My friend brought me there after lunch to grab a Soya latte which I was skeptical about at first. My prejudice against Soya lattes stems from the fact that their drinkers are commonly stereotyped as dieters. Refusing to be labelled as one of them, I have abstained from ordering a Soya latte... until today. My friend was raving about their Soya latte so much - how light &amp;amp; nutty it was... etc - that I knew I had to give it a try (at least just this once). Anyways, it was a quick-in-&amp;amp;-out dash not long enough for any snooty purist coffee drinker to give me the stink eye for ordering a Soya latte. So I did it. <br&gt;<br&gt;To my surprise... the Soya latte was really GOOD... even better than normal latte! I am a convert. It had a nice nutty flavor (just as my friend promised) and doesn&amp;#39;t taste like the sweet stuff you get from Mr.Bean or at soybean packet drinks from NTUC. The Soya milk didn&amp;#39;t overpower the coffee flavor. In fact, it tasted a lot like milk ... only less creamy (which I prefer) ... &amp;amp; thus help enhance the coffee ( I think). I was pleasantly surprised. The brand of Soya milk they used is called - Silk - which I am told is one of the best. Can&amp;#39;t wait to grab a pack at the nearest cold storage on my way home.<br&gt;<br&gt;My next coffee will definitely be a Soya Latte!"

This is not surprising - Jimmy Monkey&amp;#39;s Ironbark blend is a combination of beans from Brazil (Cerrado), Papua New Guinea (Sigri), Columbia (Kachru), Guatamala (La Laguna) and Peru (Amazonas). There is also a Columbian single origin blend available, which works well in pourover coffee. Each bean variety contributes something unique to the shot - hints of citrus, and even some chocolate notes. Ironbark is a blend that is still evolving, and is now on it&amp;#39;s third iteration. The experimentation has paid off, leaving a full bodied shot with a lingering aftertaste.<br&gt;<br&gt;The cappuccino that I ordered was notable for the initial strong hit of coffee flavour, complemented by smooth, light foam and finished with well executed latte art. The microbubbles in the foam add the smooth, silky mouthfeel that I look for, and is seen in quality cafes. This is where Ironbark is used to good effect - the lingering aftertaste is a strong base for a milk based drink, ensuring that the fundamental coffee character is retained.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had a Piccolo also, which is characterised by a more robust coffee taste, with the aftertaste lasting through the milk and foam. The milk complements the robust coffee flavour, smoothing it but not smothering it, creating a hybrid which retains the best characteristics of each - its just right and well executed. Their original place in the piccolo latte hall of fame post is deserved, and retained. There are also pourover, syphon and chemex coffees available. <br&gt;<br&gt;This is a good choice for anyone in the West of the island, and worth a quick trip on the MRT for coffee lovers elsewhere."

They have toast soldiers, good tarts, decent desserts, savoury pastas and a lot of sandwiches. All of those things are, I feel, better than their breakfast sets.

The toppings were great, it&amp;#39;s good to see places take risks with a bit unconventional toppings.  The only thing lacking was the sourdough crust.. it was a tad undercooked. For a pizza oven, it probably meant spending just 30 seconds to a min longer in the oven. APart from that.. its a decent pizza place."

The start of Sixth Ave has a couple of kopitiams once you pass the bars and restaurants. I like it. <br&gt;<br&gt;The prawn noodle shop here is very good and you can personally witness the maestro cooking the stock and prepping the ingredients most evenings after he closes (if you didn&amp;#39;t already know, making prawn stock is an elaborate task). The drinks situation is a little odd, because it doesn&amp;#39;t actually have its own drinks stall. You can order the zi char and drinks from next door. But it&amp;#39;s still a nice, relaxed spot to have dinner. They also open till late, so that&amp;#39;s a big plus. Dinner for 3 with drinks and beer cost under $30 the other night, which is usually the price of one entree down the road. So I&amp;#39;m a happy girl whenever I&amp;#39;m here, because the food is also quite good."

From the décor, to the vibe, to the food - rustic, unpretentious and delicious with the use of fresh ingredients, portion is HUGE and the coffee is good. The cafe concept is hassle free too. Just walk straight to the counter, grab the menu and order right there. You will be given a card which is also your order number so grab a table and the friendly staff will bring your food over once it&amp;#39;s ready. If the weather is not crazily hot, I will always opt to sit outside, away from the open kitchen inside the café. <br&gt;<br&gt;I came here twice - first on a busy weekday for lunch and second on a quieter weekend brunch. The sandwiches here are to die for and totally value for money. On the first visit, I had the smoked salmon sandwich while my boss had the steak with mushroom and caramelised onions sandwich, both selling at $13.90 and $15.50, respectively. Both sandwiches came with generous portion of filling (mine with lots of smoked salmon pieces on creamy dill sauce) and it sure filled me up until dinner. Unfortunately, the sandwiches are only available on weekdays and they have an entire different menu on weekend and dinner. <br&gt;<br&gt;On my second visit, it was a Saturday post gym brunch with my friend. I ordered the smoked salmon (again!) and scrambled eggs served on sourdough, while my friend ordered bacon and egg served on a mini baguette. While the dishes were executed perfectly, I thought the price was slightly on a higher side for brunch food. We paid almost $30 each for a main and a drink, hence I minus one star for this review. Even the dinner price ranges from $10 to $15 only. That&amp;#39;s bizarre when it should be the other way around.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The café is open every day - Mon to Fri until 9pm, and weekends until 4pm, so swing by if you&amp;#39;re around the area and give it a try. I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll like it as much as I do."

If I come here again (though I probably will not), id just get coffee &amp;amp; hang out here! <br&gt;<br&gt;Seating is limited as mentioned in other Yelp reviews with 2 longer benches &amp;amp; tables seating 6 ppl, and a few more tables for 2. Service was friendly, and the iced latte ($5) I ordered was good!! It had a strong espresso taste, the way I like it. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food unfortunately was lacklustre. We ordered 2 Thai disco spaghetti &amp;amp; 2 aglio olio. I expected a fusion dish of Thai basil beef with pasta but unfortunately it wasn&amp;#39;t great. The texture of the spaghetti was kind of rubbery, and perhaps another type of pasta would be better suited to enhance the taste more. The beef was the sort of minced beef in bolognese, and was quite salty. The spiciness and vaguely tom-yum taste was there, but that was all. <br&gt;From trying my friend&amp;#39;s portion, the aglio olio seemed pretty solid and garlicky with a generous serving of prawns, so perhaps it&amp;#39;s the better choice. Another table ordered the satay chicken and it was three sizable slabs of grilled chicken (with no sides though). <br&gt;<br&gt;We also tried to use the Entertainer 1 for 1 app for main courses, and they only allowed 1 use of it I.e only 1 dish was free for the 4 of us (not 2 dishes)."

Inside, it&amp;#39;s a bit dim in terms of lighting, and it&amp;#39;s a bit cramped so it&amp;#39;s best to sit outside.

I have allowed my curiosity to build up until one morning last week when I found myself particularly free and decided to venture inside Sarnies.<br&gt;<br&gt;As i pushed the door and stepped in, I seem to have walked from Telok Ayer to England, perhaps some cute little cafe in East London. I could not help notice that the overwhelming majority of the clientele is angmoh and just a second ago, I was surrounded by the laughter of uncles enjoying their kopi at the kopitiam next door so wow! that was a bit unexpected.<br&gt;<br&gt;The set up is simple, there is a huge counter where you order and get your food and drinks and then a few tables and chairs against the wall and filling up the rest of the limited space.  A lot of people seem to opt for the outdoor seats which is a pretty good spot for people watching on the busy strip of telok ayer.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Having quickly scanned the menu on the board, I decided to get the salmon cream cheese bagel since I have not had a bagel for a while (actually never in Singapore to be accurate).  I was a bit disappointed that I could not choose the type of bagel. It is definitely not cheap, my bagel came at a cost of almost S$10 and with a flat white that brings the total damage to 14. I mean, to be fair, the bagel is huge and if you are willing to pay 10 for a sandwich in the cbd this is acceptable but still, $14 for breakfast seems a bit on the high side.  I opted to bring my bagel back to the office since the place is too packed.  Delighted to find that they have taken the time to wrap my bagel up in foil so by the time I sat down at my desk and opened the wrapping, it&amp;#39;s still nice and warm.  The bagel itself is pretty good, soft and smooth cream cheese that blends well with the salmon and the portion is quite generous.  I really enjoyed it so quality wise I cannot complain. I heard their brunch menu is pretty good so will come back and try."

Missed the day menu by 2 hours (I was there at 6). But the dessert special (churros) convinced me to stay. It&amp;#39;s one of those treats that are so difficult to find in Singapore that I always jump at the chance to try some whenever the opportunity arises, although previous attempts have been somewhat dismal.<br&gt;<br&gt;Churros took a bit long to arrive (from my seat facing the kitchen, it seemed as though this applied to all the food in general) but exceeded my expectations. For just $8 (disclaimer: I consider any reasonably-sized dessert priced below $25 affordable.... Unless its just a slice of cake), I got 5 large sticks of churros. These were nice and crisp on the outside and perfectly moist within, substantial but not too dense. It came with a generous cup of chocolate sauce for dipping in, and some salt at the side. Tip: dip the churros in the chocolate, then dab on a bit of salt. The interplay between the sweet and savory flavours when you do that makes the dessert so much more interesting!<br&gt;<br&gt;Appreciated the service, I was there alone and the staff went out of their way to make me feel welcome, by engaging me in polite conversation and constantly checking if there was something else I needed (and sharing their thoughts about the churros!)

A sandwich or salad ranges from about $13-$15, and an iced tea is a staggering $7. That said, the sandwiches and salads that I&amp;#39;ve had have been HUGE. Like, too big to put in your mouth HUGE for the sandwich (yeah that&amp;#39;s what she said) and I was surprised I was STILL EATING HUGE for the salad. <br&gt;<br&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve seen the steak sandwich, the roast chicken sandwich, and the chicken pesto salad first hand, and they&amp;#39;re all huge. A main in and of themselves huge. Worth the price? Ehmmmmm close. Portions wise definitely, quality wise really on the border definitely.<br&gt;<br&gt;I highly recommend the pesto chicken salad. Chicken pesto salad. Whatever. There&amp;#39;re mushrooms, pesto, TONS of chicken, plenty of greens, cherry tomatoes, and a big slab of bread. You&amp;#39;ll notice I&amp;#39;ve been using a lot of capitalisation in this review. Portions here just FEEL LIKE THAT. IN YOUR FACE. <br&gt;<br&gt;As for their $7 iced teas, it&amp;#39;s pricey, but they are quite delicious. The green tea with honey and ginger, the orange with cinnamon are both subtly flavoured and very thirst-quenching. Okay, a little wallet hurting, but I like iced tea so I&amp;#39;ve usually been able to convince myself that it&amp;#39;s worth it. (It&amp;#39;s not, not really... I&amp;#39;m really good at lying to myself.)<br&gt;<br&gt;The coffee&amp;#39;s decent, but the staff. The staff are friendly, and really cool. They really try to engage you, they make sure to smile, and it really feels like they&amp;#39;re having fun as they work through the lunch crush. <br&gt;<br&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re in the area and a little stumped for what to eat, I&amp;#39;d give Sarnies a try. They&amp;#39;re a little pricey, but it&amp;#39;s a very very pleasant experience."

My greek salad was mot well spun resulting in alot of water in the bowl, making the vegetable soggy and unpleasant. However, the service was commendable. We reflected the problems, and they were taken back, and replaced. We even had a free muffin on the house with a staff checking if the replacement was okay.<br&gt;Perhaps it wasn&amp;#39;t a good day that we had visited since most items sold out by the time we reached there.

They are out of their mind. It was more a crappé than a frappé. They focused on making the food and drink look fancy to make the price more expensive, and don&amp;#39;t focus on taste, so your paying more for a good looking drink that tastes different to what is described. The only reason this is two stars instead of one is the fact that the service wad quick and atmosphere was nice, with jazzy music in the background.

Kudos to whoever the interior designer was.<br&gt;<br&gt;They sell, tarts, cakes, brownies and etc. Even cookie and cake mixes in jars. How wonderful! But what captivated us the most were the cupcakes on display. Me being the salted caramel lover ordered 2 of those, vanilla and hazelnut chocolate ones. <br&gt;<br&gt;Prices for the cupcakes were alright, standard. But the drinks! Blimey! $7 for a cup of lemonade? Eh?! And oh! You might as well know that they don&amp;#39;t offer you any paper bag to stuff your cake boxes.

(A useful handle for when you&amp;#39;re commuting with cupcakes!) <br&gt;<br&gt;I love the ritual of hopping a few doors down to Books Actually to grab some reading material and then settling myself into a quiet corner at PV Bakery.

While her HV store is small and cosy, this is welcoming and enticing. I love the wide space and benches. The counter space allows us to stand in front and ponder.

There are nearby MRT stops at Esplanade and Promenade on the Circle Line, and it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to find.<br&gt;<br&gt;The cafe itself is super cute but kinda small, and its decor is very very pink, with a My Melody statue outside and a garden-type theme going on inside. There isn&amp;#39;t a lot of room, but the ambiance is comfortable and there are lots of good photo ops. They don&amp;#39;t sell toys or other Sanrio merch here, so the main thing is getting cute pictures.<br&gt;<br&gt;Unfortunately, there was a massive queue, even though we went at 3pm on a Friday. We arrived at 3:15pm and waited until 5:15pm before we got a table. There was a staff member named Melody who did a great job communicating with those in the queue and was doing her best to keep everyone happy and entertained, and there was another staff member, Kendrick, who was doing the same and also taking pictures for customers by the statue and outside the cafe. We definitely went on a busy day, and the rest of the cafe staff were a little overwhelmed, but they did a great job keeping everything running smoothly, and were very nice and cordial.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food exceeded our expectations for a themed cafe...after all, you usually visit these places for the theme part, not the cafe part. My friend and I both ended up ordering the same things - the Princess Bunny curry for SGD$18.90, and the strawberry yogurt parfait for SGD$16.00. It was about a 15min wait for the curry to arrive. It came with a generous serving of rice, naturally colored pink with beetroot, and the chicken in the curry was perfectly crispy on the outside and hot and delicious on the inside. It had a subtle spicy flavor and was just plain delicious. We requested the yogurt right after we tore through the curry, and it was a LOT of yogurt! The macaroon on top was a cute finishing touch, and it was super filling. It&amp;#39;s on the sour side, kind of like Greek yogurt, and the strawberries themselves are extremely fresh, but if you&amp;#39;re not used to the individual flavors, you may want to mix all the layers together.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, you should definitely come here for both the theme and the food, but as of now, the line to get in is long, and you may end up with a one- or two-hour long wait before you sit down. The menu size does leave something to be desired; there are only a few main course options available, with no sides or snacks, and there are only three signature beverage options, two of which are sugary milkshakes that really should be considered desserts (but there are really cool and unique tea options and a nice coffee selection). Hopefully, as time passes, the initial hype crowds will shrink to a much more manageable size, the wait times will drop, and the menu will see more variety.<br&gt;<br&gt;Glad to make this one of my last Singaporean experiences for the near future!"

Let&amp;#39;s start with quick tips for first timers:<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Cats are not dogs. If you keep dangling the toy and they&amp;#39;re not taking the bait, it&amp;#39;s not going to happen. Also, some cats are just not into petting so if you&amp;#39;re trying to touch it and it&amp;#39;s shying away, please stop<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Let the cat come to you. Sit down near it, on the floor. Let them smell your hands before touching them. Respecting the cat will allow you to earn their trust the quickest.<br&gt;<br&gt;3. MOST IMPORTANT TIP: Try to ask the employees if you can see the cats and the room before signing up for an hour. You should see if the cats are in a napping mood, or if the other patrons are interacting in a way that you can enjoy. I actually ended up leaving 10 minutes early because a pushy group of 10 people came in and started being loud and bothering the cats. Before, it was myself, and a local couple and a German couple, and we were totally fine. Check the situation before you commit! This is the single most important piece of advice I can give you for enjoying your cat cafe experience.<br&gt;<br&gt;Alright, as for the experience itself:<br&gt;<br&gt;PRICING: I don&amp;#39;t think S$14 is expensive for an hour and a drink (the complimentary drink can be mineral water or coke). Think about how much it costs to raise a cat and realize some of your money goes to support causes to take care of cats<br&gt;<br&gt;DRINKS: I got the special, a Thai Iced Tea. It was an additional $2.50 on top, but I think it was fairly priced. Was it worth it? Not really, nothing special here. The latte art for the coffee based drinks seemed decent. And for some other hot drinks, they give you a nice ceramic cover to keep your drink warm and the cat hair out.<br&gt;<br&gt;CATS: Definitely a range of characters here. Elliot was my favorite, a long-haired softie. There are a few cats that seem like not really people cats, cats that would naturally avoid everyone. It would be great if people could not think of cat cafes as petting zoos, but as cafes that happen to have cats. So enjoy doing something else while appreciating cats while you can. Overall, there were about 7 cats when I visited but at least 3 were sleeping basically the entire time. AGAIN, CHECK THE ROOM BEFORE YOU COMMIT- if it&amp;#39;s nap time, come back later.<br&gt;<br&gt;INTERACTION: They do appreciate cat treats, and the staff will occasionally give people cat treats to give to cats. I think it&amp;#39;s a good thing that you can&amp;#39;t buy unlimited cat treats because people would ultimately overfeed the cats to get their attention. This isn&amp;#39;t good for making $$$, but it&amp;#39;s definitely better for the cats. Well done, management.<br&gt;<br&gt;ROOM: Nicely decorated and ventilated, not too cold. You can hear noise from the street but it&amp;#39;s not bad. There&amp;#39;s a number of seats, I bet the room could seat 10 max. However, due to the distribution of cats, people will naturally concentrate in certain areas. There are plenty of cat structures.<br&gt; <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I&amp;#39;m giving 3 stars. To be honest, it&amp;#39;s not the fault of the management per se as to why I felt that this was a 3 star experience. Here&amp;#39;s why: <br&gt;<br&gt;First of all, half the cats were asleep when I came (Saturday afternoon), but I know cats sleep for over 14 hours a day, I have cats. I should have checked the room before I committed.<br&gt;<br&gt;Second, of the cats that were awake, there were a few that just weren&amp;#39;t really into interaction. I think it&amp;#39;s food that the cats are sourced from bad situations, but perhaps they could select more of the cats that are proven to be forwardly-friendly. I&amp;#39;ve met cats like this before, I know they exist. <br&gt;<br&gt;Third and most importantly, the group that came in during my last 20 minutes. A group of 10 Chinese kids (probably college age) that were fairly loud, shoving around to take photos of the cats. I was sitting there just chilling with this cat and one of these guys started taking pictures of me with the cat and I just felt really awkward. Again, for my first half hour, I was here with a German couple and a Singaporean couple and we were all polite and respecting each others&amp;#39; space and it was great. This really soured the experience for me and this is why I left a bit early.<br&gt;<br&gt;OVERALL - an A-OK experience. I might swing by singapore again and visit the other cat cafe nearby Bugis and give some comparison feedback."

So I did some research before heading to Lola&amp;#39;s Cafe which was suggested by Ms K. Strangely, it seems like the entire nation is heading for the brunches instead of the dinners (perhaps the fetish for egg bens has yet to subside). <br&gt;<br&gt;One of the most tried-and-tested dishes here is the Avocado Egg Bens ($15). Nothing much astonishing about this but the excellently toasted brioche was so crunchy and ideal for mopping up the mixture of runny egg and sweet salad dressing that collected on the plate.The Honey and Paprika Wings ($10)  were indeed so popular that customers who couldn&amp;#39;t snap a seat, were ordering it for takeaway. Juicy and sweet, these chickens would definitely be even satisfying with more spice. <br&gt;<br&gt;The dark chocolate tart with coffee cream ($5) could be the best bet out of the three sweets we&amp;#39;ve had. Speckles of sea salt tempered the bittersweet cacao ganache within a thin chocolate tart shell, though I couldn&amp;#39;t recall tasting baileys or espresso in the cream. Meanwhile, I failed to comprehend an Earl Grey Tart ($5) whose filling resembles mudflow. Not sure if it was intended to be of such loose consistency or to be curd-like as those of lemon meringue tarts. The Black Tea Prune Brownie with Vanilla ice cream ($7) might not win brownie points on its looks but the clever use of tea-soaked prunes injected another dimension of sweetness to an otherwise archetypical baked chocolate cake."

Lola&amp;#39;s Café has only been around for about 3 months, it surely added more liveliness to the area. This vintage café is also easily accessible - it takes you less than 5 minutes to walk from Kovan MRT (the exit opposite Heartland Mall).<br&gt;<br&gt;This café is set up by 2 young entrepreneurs, Choo Kiat and June. Besides being the boss, Choo Kiat is the chef cum barista. On the other hand, June is responsible for the pastries that you see in the café. By the way, &amp;#39;Lola&amp;#39; is actually June&amp;#39;s middle name.<br&gt;<br&gt;This small and quaint café is filled with a variety of vintage furniture and mood lightings. I was particularly attracted to their tables - they are all made from our traditional sewing machines! Furthermore, most of the vintage furniture here are for sale - Do check them out if you&amp;#39;ll like to add a bit of character to your room! <br&gt;<br&gt;The most unique part of the cafe is their beer menu consists of a good variety of carefully drafted beers from boutique breweries in US, UK and Belgium. <br&gt;<br&gt;I went for their Matcha Latte which costs $5.00. The latte was pretty smooth and had a sweet aftertaste. It&amp;#39;s a little sweeter over here compared to other cafes, you might want to ask for less sugar. I also tried their Banana Earl Grey Tart ($4.00) which is one of their specialties. It&amp;#39;s topped with a layer of sugar and pistachio nuts which tastes very crunchy. The Earl Grey paste was a little too moist though.<br&gt;<br&gt;My favourite was their Wasabi White Chocolate Mousse ($7.00). Never would I have expected wasabi to go well with white chocolate! An exotic mix of ingredients, it&amp;#39;s a surprising recipe and very delicious! Don&amp;#39;t worry about the spiciness of the wasabi; it&amp;#39;s very gentle and not too overwhelming. The sweetness of the white chocolate complements the overall taste and it melts in your mouth! It&amp;#39;s so unique I can&amp;#39;t describe it with words. You have to try it for yourself!<br&gt;<br&gt;Lola&amp;#39;s cafe is very conducive for reading and for studying. You could also reward yourselves with some savoury desserts while working your brain cells! It&amp;#39;s also a good place to hang out with your friends in the late evenings over some beer and honey wings. Service was great, staff were all very friendly. I will certainly come back again to try out their brunch and beers!<br&gt;<br&gt;P.S: This cafe is free of GST and Service Charge!"

So I did some research before heading to Lola&amp;#39;s Cafe which was suggested by Ms K. Strangely, it seems like the entire nation is heading for the brunches instead of the dinners (perhaps the fetish for egg bens has yet to subside). <br&gt;<br&gt;One of the most tried-and-tested dishes here is the Avocado Egg Bens ($15). Nothing much astonishing about this but the excellently toasted brioche was so crunchy and ideal for mopping up the mixture of runny egg and sweet salad dressing that collected on the plate.The Honey and Paprika Wings ($10)  were indeed so popular that customers who couldn&amp;#39;t snap a seat, were ordering it for takeaway. Juicy and sweet, these chickens would definitely be even satisfying with more spice. <br&gt;<br&gt;The dark chocolate tart with coffee cream ($5) could be the best bet out of the three sweets we&amp;#39;ve had. Speckles of sea salt tempered the bittersweet cacao ganache within a thin chocolate tart shell, though I couldn&amp;#39;t recall tasting baileys or espresso in the cream. Meanwhile, I failed to comprehend an Earl Grey Tart ($5) whose filling resembles mudflow. Not sure if it was intended to be of such loose consistency or to be curd-like as those of lemon meringue tarts. The Black Tea Prune Brownie with Vanilla ice cream ($7) might not win brownie points on its looks but the clever use of tea-soaked prunes injected another dimension of sweetness to an otherwise archetypical baked chocolate cake."

I know we have Serangoon Gardens and all but that area is seriously too congested for my liking. Recently, the brothers and i checked out Lola&amp;#39;s Cafe, a fairly new joint located at Simon Road, just a stone&amp;#39;s throw away from our regular Punggol Nasi Lemak haunt (i don&amp;#39;t like it btw). <br&gt;<br&gt;Lola&amp;#39;s Cafe is a cheerful cafe with a limited seating capacity. I reckon it sits about 20 to 30 pax. And they are really popular. Go early, put your booking down on the iPad booking system and be prepared to wait.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard good things about the brunch menu (available from 10am - 3pm on weekends) but i&amp;#39;ve yet to try it. Friends that i&amp;#39;ve sent in Lola&amp;#39;s way enjoyed the Avocado Eggs Benedict very much. All my favorite ingredients in 1 dish, you bet i&amp;#39;d order that next time.<br&gt;<br&gt;We met late for supper and picked from the bites section. The Truffle fries with grated Parmesan cheese ($12) was MEH. I&amp;#39;m a fan of soggy fries but this style is simply not compatible with truffle oil. The fries were bland and lacking in the truffle aroma.<br&gt;<br&gt;My favorite is the Honey and Paprika Crispy Wings ($9). You have to order this! This is an order from the Tummy Ministry. I loved the light crispy batter which stayed crunchy throughout the meal. The meat was nicely marinated and went perfectly with the light touch of honey which coats it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Their homemade desserts are apparently quite popular here but both desserts that we tried were less than satisfactory. The Dark Chocolate Sea Salt tart with Kahlua coffee cream ($5) sounded more delicious than it tasted. Filling to tart ration was off (too much tart) and the tart lacked in the butter department and was simply too crumbly (and i don&amp;#39;t mean it in a good way). The tart tasted like one of those factory manufactured pastry shells. Meh. <br&gt;<br&gt;Sticky Honey Apple cake with French Vanilla ice cream ($7). According to the brothers, who aren&amp;#39;t very picky with food,  Swensen&amp;#39;s apple crumble tastes better and i concur. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had the Matcha green tea latte ($6) which was worse than Starbucks. It was terribly bland. Will never order this again.<br&gt;<br&gt;I was hoping that i would be head over heels in love with Lola&amp;#39;s Cafe but i wasn&amp;#39;t. Hopefully their brunch will change my opinion about them. Till then."

The latte was pretty smooth and had a sweet aftertaste. It&amp;#39;s a little sweeter over here compared to other cafes, you might want to ask for less sugar. I also tried their Banana Earl Grey Tart ($4.00) which is one of their specialties. It&amp;#39;s topped with a layer of sugar and pistachio nuts which tastes very crunchy. The Earl Grey paste was a little too moist though.<br&gt;<br&gt;My favourite was their Wasabi White Chocolate Mousse ($7.00). Never would I have expected wasabi to go well with white chocolate! An exotic mix of ingredients, it&amp;#39;s a surprising recipe and very delicious! Don&amp;#39;t worry about the spiciness of the wasabi; it&amp;#39;s very gentle and not too overwhelming. The sweetness of the white chocolate complements the overall taste and it melts in your mouth! It&amp;#39;s so unique I can&amp;#39;t describe it with words. You have to try it for yourself!<br&gt;<br&gt;Lola&amp;#39;s cafe is very conducive for reading and for studying. You could also reward yourselves with some savoury desserts while working your brain cells! It&amp;#39;s also a good place to hang out with your friends in the late evenings over some beer and honey wings. Service was great, staff were all very friendly. I will certainly come back again to try out their brunch and beers!<br&gt;<br&gt;P.S: This cafe is free of GST and Service Charge!"

Mo and I have had croissants and baked goods from Paris to NYC and I was pleasantly surprised by how good they were here.<br&gt;<br&gt;*Note: Do yourself a favor and SKIP the toasties here though. While the sourdough bread itself was good. The execution of the toppings was not great and very skimpy. Attached pics for reference.

You can also request for just ice cream in a cup which was what we did. The honey and fig ice cream was delicious and at $2. it was quite a steal in the city center area. It will be $3.50 for the ice cream in the petit croissant. I hope they will retain the price for a long time.

Some of the seating area is caked with dust, and it stayed that way my entire trip. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food isn&amp;#39;t very fresh, or at least half of the time. The baked goods in particular show this. During my stay, I ordered from them a raisin bun, kouign amann, berry tarte, petit antoine, canele, paris brest. Half of those were either stale or dried out. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service leaves more to be desired. Sometimes they&amp;#39;re always around, and sometimes they&amp;#39;re nowhere to be found. It takes FOREVER to get the check, so long that I regret not ordering takeout. They don&amp;#39;t like to take dirty plates away, and instead just leave them on your table. I ordered a croque monsieur and a sunny-side-up egg on top (hence making a croque madame), and they just didn&amp;#39;t understand the combination!! 10 minutes later, I received a salmon quiche. I tell them that&amp;#39;s not what I ordered, and they ask &amp;#34;would you like to keep it?&amp;#34; Yeah No! <br&gt;<br&gt;They have calorie bombs, such as their pancake breakfast sandwich/burger with tater tots, and yet they also have healthier alternatives, such as juices and salads. <br&gt;<br&gt;So on the bright side, the servers &amp;amp; manager are super friendly, and the coffee is made well.

I queued up, placed my order, and found a seat so that I could partake in this bakery item. My first bite lived up to expectations. The croissant was amazing. I cherished every morsel, and after it was over, I was so hooked that I had already made future plans to visit this place. Singapore has many bakeries on the island, but not many specialize in Western bread items. Tiong Bahru bakery gets it, and I&amp;#39;m glad they exist.

The kouign amman is justifiably famous-- it&amp;#39;s a buttery, carmelized, salty-sweet gooey bunch of deliciousness. Have that with a cup of the really good coffee and you&amp;#39;ve made a damn fine start (or end!) to your day.  The baguettes are also up there at best-in-Singapore level so take one of those home with you. Most of the baked goods are delicious with the exception of the brioche which, as a previous reviewer mentioned, is dry and makes you kick yourself for not ordering the kouign amman you had your eye on to begin with. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was in Orchard yesterday and saw a new outlet in Tang&amp;#39;s.

It was consumed at room temperature but remained crispy.<br&gt;However, some of the pastries left me in a blur. The Raisin Roll (right) was average while the Pandan Flan (Bottom Left) lacked any distinct pandan aroma or flavour and the pastry was soggy. Meanwhile, The Rapsberry Crumble (Top Left) was underbaked resulting in a slightly chewy lacklustre pastry and the crumble toppings were too little.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Just as I thought there would be no new items anymore, it&amp;#39;s Christmas specials- A Chocolate Snowball Globe tart took me by surprise. Filled with sweet milk chocolate mousse and the tangy pineapple and passionfruit compote, the chocolate ball sat on a crumbly almond tart whose sweetness was just right.<br&gt;At the centre sits a mini delicate red balloon of salty raspberry sauce which burst open at the poke of a fork.

Dressed in a self-serviced concept, you will help yourself to a common corner with cutlery, sugar sticks, drinking glasses &amp;amp; bottles of tap water. Facing the bustling Din Tai Fung restaurant, this bakery is no lack of patrons. Spontaneously I joined the line for my order at the counter. In the queue, you could quickly scan through the options  in the glass display. Categorized in 3 sections, sweet &amp;amp; savory buns/breads being the first; ready-made sandwiches in the middle; cakes &amp;amp; pastries selection the last, before reaching the cashier. Be sure to note your table number so that any beverages/food that requires time to prepare, can be delivered to you efficiently.  <br&gt;<br&gt;It pays to be aware of the chef signature most of the time although it may not be a hit every time. Here, croissant is the trademark of Cherrier. I have seen mixed reviews on this viennoiserie bread - some find it excessively rich and buttery while others are hooked on them. I agreed with the latter, it was very good. One could tell the difference at first sight - very distinctive thick airy folds. The crust is very tenderizing and instead of being crumbly, each flake held firmly to the dough pretty well. Lesser mess on the table as a result. Unlike other French style croissant, this one taste less buttery than those &amp;#34;ultra-rich&amp;#34; dead-oily ones. The one at Paul Bakery perhaps should stand aside and I gladly choose them over Wild Honey&amp;#39;s. Even though, I still love the ones at Maison Kayser, Cherrier&amp;#39;s suit me better - seriously a balanced and less weighty taste.<br&gt;<br&gt;I see many eulogizing the breton cake - Kouign Aman; strangely, I idolized the Almond Brioche for its endearing taste. It didn&amp;#39;t appear catchy but somewhat burnt and stiff. Don&amp;#39;t belittle this slab that arrives massive. I am surprised by its light fluffy texture when I knifed it. Encircled by a crisp crust, the middle was moist and almond-rich with a gentle sweetness. While people next to my table were busy chatting, my dining partner saw me busy gnawing on the slab!"

This place has gotten quite a lot of positive word of mouth (WOM). Despite its location; at least 15 minutes away from the nearest MRT station (Bugis), this place was packed when I went there twice during lunch time. And it will not be easy to find this shop if you are not familiar with the area. In case you are wondering, this shop specialises in Swiss rolls. <br&gt;<br&gt;Stacks of unroll Swiss rolls. Yes, they make it themselves and they sell it in a whole roll; uncut.<br&gt;<br&gt;Wide variety of Swiss rolls and the prices. <br&gt;<br&gt;Nothing fancy about their packaging. Looks simple and dull.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered  a Kaya Swiss Roll and a Coffee Swiss Roll  for $13.00. The packaging and swiss rolls look simple. But appearances can be deceiving. The swiss rolls were soft and spongy.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Kaya Swiss Roll which is their best seller. The kaya was tasty, rich and fragrant. This is really a must try. Totally fantastic. The owner say that to keep the cake in the fridge and finish it up by 3 days. Well, it was so delicious that we finish it up within 24 hours.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Coffee Swiss Roll was quite delicious too. Soft, rich tasting coffee flavoured swiss roll.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you have not tried this, you will not know what you are missing. They sell lots of other flavours too such  as Blueberry, Chocolate, Durian, Green Tea, Mango, Strawberry and Orange. As as it&amp;#39;s shop name shout out, it&amp;#39;s swiss rolls are really rich and good! <br&gt;<br&gt;Full review and photos at FoodieFC&amp;#39;s blog."

My personal favourite is the Mandarin Orange flavour (which makes a great Chinese New Year snack), but the Kaya, Mango and Durian are quite popular as well. Ok who am I kidding, all the flavours are good, but I&amp;#39;m a little let down by the chocolate flavour because it&amp;#39;s not as rich as I generally like it.<br&gt;<br&gt;It comes in a long roll about the length of your arm (my arm length at any rate) and are great for sharing if you&amp;#39;re feeling generous.

Also, always have a back up flavour in mind if you must leave the shop with a cake, cos some flavours may be out at time of purchase and it&amp;#39;s better to just call out the next flavour that you want than to stand there and think.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, a great dessert for the family to share or to bring to group gatherings (cos each swiss roll is about the length of a 30cm long ruler).

The sponge is soft and truly moist, a real treat with a good cup of coffee for your afternoon break.<br&gt;<br&gt;The shop is tucked away in a row a shops and if you&amp;#39;re not looking hard enough you might just miss the nondescript looking front door."

It is such a traditional and peripheral cake that few pastry chefs in Singapore would ever think of making one. The rarity drove me to get a slice at Dolcetto by Basilico, despite being already full to the brims. <br&gt;<br&gt;This Italian pastry shop used to be my to-go place for takeaway pastries when it was still under the name of &amp;#34;Something to Go&amp;#34;. The interior and menu have been revamped, but the signatures like Strawberry Torte, Praline Torte and Espresso Tiramisu still stay. In the spirit of all things Italian, all the pastries here that involved chocolate are made with Tuscany&amp;#39;s organic chocolate brand Amedei, which is perhaps also one of the world&amp;#39;s most expensive chocolate.<br&gt;<br&gt;Take for example the Amedei Chocolate Pumpkin Tart ($9) that took a sinful detour from the usual pumpkin pie. The mastery of the cacao tones is virtually undisputed, so does the crisp tart shell which not overworked and perfect in volume with the filling. Pumpkin is one of my favorite ingredients but the taste seemed to have wandered off to elsewhere and did not meld together with the chocolate<br&gt;<br&gt;The Praline Torte ($9) is hard not to love with the appealing crunchy base. But I was craving for something less milky, something more intense and I figured that the other option of Amedei Dark Chocolate Cake would have satisfied my lust for chocolate.<br&gt;<br&gt;Bright juicy and sweet, the soft chunks of pineapple rested amidst the delectable vanilla baked custard in this humble Italian Crostata ($9). But instead of being served the traditional family way in big, rustic free-form version, it has been elevated to the fine ranks of French gateaux with mild &amp;#34;Violette perfumes&amp;#34; and a touch of gold on top of the dainty raspberries.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Espresso Marsala Cake ($9) was our unanimous pick. It might seem like a messy pile of various textures (crunch, custard, sponge, ganache, gelee) but I loved the sweetness from the Marsala wine even though the espresso kick wasn&amp;#39;t assertive as I had imagined. And of course the delightful sound of the crushed chocolate pearls is music to the ears.<br&gt;<br&gt;One can&amp;#39;t miss the conspicuous fresh-baked pane (breads) that are stacked along the wall. We&amp;#39;ve finally got a taste of the famous squid ink panini with fresh king crab and prawns ($13), a hearty dense and chewy sandwich that seemed a little deprived of tantalizing juices from the filling. The Roasted Chicken &amp;amp; Cheese Foccacia might not be brimming with luxury ingredients but the flavors were simple and comforting. <br&gt;<br&gt;Many may raise eyebrows at the sight of Squid Ink Salmon Macaron but it is quite a success. In fact, a good step to convert those who usually steer away from these sugary meringue bites. The chewy shells appeared rather flattened but the flavors were spot on, especially the Vanilla Prosecco and Cassis."

I seldom frequent a pâtisserie, at most a boulangerie. Most commonly seen these days, are either tagging a European heritage or a Japanese label, anchoring at some malls - majestic or humble. Another group will hole up at some remote or bustling hotels, sometimes an extension of the main restaurant while others are stand alone without parentage. When the now-defunct Something-To-Go at Regent Singapore finally vacate itself from the lobby, the unit is quickly replaced by another gourmet Italian pastry shop; serves artisanal bakeries/pastries &amp;#34;bites-on-the-GO&amp;#34; from Basilico kitchen - the Italian buffet restaurant on level 2. Confession I must, I have never been to Regent Singapore, at best, driving past. So, when others mentioned about the takeaway deli over at the hotel, I couldn&amp;#39;t visualize where and how to get to it. Until today, I finally left FOODprints at Dolcetto after a trip to St Regis, Singapore.<br&gt;<br&gt;Once you enter the hotel main entrance, head towards the lobby at 12o&amp;#39;clock, until you reach the far end which is walled in glass panels. Dolcetto is just on your 9 o&amp;#39;clock - sit tightly in a corner. With a few round tables and long sofa in the lobby, one simply shop in the deli - scan the display, place your order and make the payment before pulling your tray of items off the cashier to any available seats. Barely any soul, except a few in-house guests waiting to check into their rooms. The time was 2.30pm, a Friday. I found myself a decent table to interrogate my subject, though I wish it has been a date.<br&gt;<br&gt;Spoilt with choices, I cherry-picked the elegant looking mini tart - Forest Berries. This beautiful treat enchants you with its sweetness that was meant for the faint heart - mild and calming. A very thin layer of delicate custard was seen cushioned between a bushel of huge plumpish strawberries &amp;amp; its cousins and a less buttery crisp shell. Though the silkiness of the custard won me over, I still prefer they rubbed in more butter for a richer tart shell. Perhaps a few more scoops of fillings to satiate my greed. Prior to that, I think it has been overpriced for its content, $9 a piece.<br&gt;<br&gt;Then comes the savory. Less attractive, something that you wouldn&amp;#39;t care for a second look probably. Many may pace up and down the display and thought it was just another sweet mini French burger treats - Macaroon. Stay close and read those tags which spelled their names in flowing strokes, you will realized that they ain&amp;#39;t all sweet treats. I asked the lady for a Smoked Salmon classic, and the dusky cookie make it to the plate, alongside the jeweled tart. A complete contrast between a beauty and the beast from afar! Instantly, prejudice sets in when confronted with visual appeal but it turned out to be an unfair judgement. If you think a sweet shell is at odds with salmon fillings, reconsider that please. I am surprised by the unconventional making, the mixture of mellow sweet crisp cookie embodied a dollop of silky creme wrapping some melting salmon with a rich savory &amp;amp; smokey finish. No overbearing fishiness was seen marring the light, gently crackling almond meringue shell, heavenly. For once, I tasted a refined French treat which didn&amp;#39;t put me off with its immeasurable sweetness but one that was light and playful. A $2.25 per piece is so reasonable to ask for another.<br&gt;<br&gt;To wash down my tea treats, I had a dose of cappuccino that smoothed my throat but less lingering. I am glad that this cup was worth $5.60 instead of $15 that was charged by mistake for 3 doses at first. Please do check your bill if it sounds unbelievable, I was happy that I did.<br&gt;<br&gt;Do not be misled by my choices, there are plenty of artisanal breads, sweet muffins, doughnuts, mouth-watering sandwiches and even tiny sweets like cookies and chocolates on the shelves. But be forewarned that the price is steep.<br&gt;<br&gt;If there&amp;#39;s anything that I would bond with, the freestyle squid ink smoked salmon shall be it! This classic arrives without confining rules - highly praised. I will be most happy to ask for a second piece anytime soon whenever Dolcetto is call upon."

The coffee is fantastic, no doubt about it. Easy to drink and beautifully balanced. Just the way I like it! Secondly Dutch Colony sources coffee beans from all around the world. The coffee selection is what you would suspect from any fine coffee locale: (i) Flat white, (ii) cappuccino, (iii) lattes, (iv) iced mocha, etc. Sorry, no specialty coffee offerings from what I remember. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food is also great, but unfortunately there were some misses.  If you haven&amp;#39;t noticed from my pictures, I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of the French Toast. Probably, one of the best French Toasts I&amp;#39;ve had in Singapore so far. What&amp;#39;s not to love about a french toast topped with strawberry, caramelized banana with syrup and vanilla ice cream as sides?  The Espresso Bacon Baked Eggs with Wasabi Mayo was not too bad as well. Unfortunately, the Sweet Potato Truffle Fries were bit soggy. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, Dutch Colony&amp;#39;s coffee is among the best you will find in SG. I knock a star off because the food portions are a bit on the small side considering the price point, and the truffle fries were a bit of a miss."

Needless to say, one could skip the Thai Milk Tea loaf. Well, luckily for them, the Matcha Bundt cake was superb.<br&gt;<br&gt;The cake was moist and we could taste the distinct green tea in it. The icing was a little sweet but that could be easily scraped off so no issue. Can they make this a bigger slice please??<br&gt;<br&gt;This is certainly going to be my regular hangout from now.

The sister café of Ronin is much brighter with an almost pastel color interior, less stuffy, lots of natural light, an open kitchen with suction / ventilation system that works and a big &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; wall at the outdoor seating area. The café exudes a relaxing vibe unlike the more &amp;#34;gothic&amp;#34; sister (Ronin) located just a short walk away.<br&gt;<br&gt;Punch is located exactly opposite Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Station and about 50 meters away from Dehesa (previously Communal). If you&amp;#39;re coming alone or with one or two friends, getting a table is not that difficult but if you&amp;#39;re in a group of six and above, it is better to book in advance. The kind folks will hold your table until 11am, before releasing to whoever comes first.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The past weekend, I organized a brunch meetup with fellow yelpers and had a good meal here. The 10 of us ordered almost everything in the menu including the 2 specials. My poached eggs with mashed avocado was pretty good with nicely poached eggs sitting on top 2 slices of sourdough with a side of burnt lemon for that &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; taste. The portion is perfect for one and just right when you washed down with a cuppa joe, in my case, I chose my favorite chai latte. While some suggest that the chai latte could be more &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; and the spices be more pronounced, I like the way it is. With our ever warm Singapore weather, I like my chai to me on the &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; side and less milky. It&amp;#39;s just a personal preference and it works for me. <br&gt;<br&gt;I took a small bite of my friend&amp;#39;s earl grey pancakes with poached pear drenched in chocolate sauce and it was really good and addictive. Again, not too big of a portion for one. While I hope the team could come up with a more extensive brunch menu (currently only 7 items), that&amp;#39;s not entirely a bad thing. That means the young budding chefs know their ability and only want to concentrate on a few items they do best rather than an ambitious menu while delivering a mediocre fare. If the usual waffles, porridge and eggs benny doesn&amp;#39;t fancy you, then check with the friendly staff on the weekly specials. <br&gt;<br&gt;Staffs are friendly and our glass of water are always filled. While we try to milk a complimentary salted caramel brownie by singing birthday song to me, it was a birthday that I don&amp;#39;t even know! And if you wonder, we failed in the attempt. The salted caramel brownie comes with a price tag of $5. <br&gt;<br&gt;If there&amp;#39;s one thing that puts me off is the price that is perhaps, a tad higher than your usual cafe. But then, it&amp;#39;s Singapore where you&amp;#39;re expected to fork out extra at a slightly better establishment. I&amp;#39;m definitely coming back to check out their dinner one of these days. <br&gt;<br&gt;Punch is a solid 3.5 star, round up to 4. Good stuff"

We decided at the spur of the moment to rush down and take away a few dishes for a family lunch. Because of our hunger and over enthusiasm to try the food, we completely forgot about photos. Promise to upload a few the next time I&amp;#39;m there. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now.... back to food. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed that there&amp;#39;s been a lot of disagreements and &amp;#34;arguments&amp;#34; online lately about how &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; a Peranakan Restaurant is. Because of the many influences and different background of each family, and lack of belief in writing down recipes, there isn&amp;#39;t really a genuine, authentic recipe for Nonya food. Sure, the basic ingredients are the same, but the way it&amp;#39;s cooked varies from family to family. <br&gt;<br&gt;To me, good Nonya food needs to be the following: <br&gt;1. it has to be fragrant. A lot of Peranakan dishes depend on a solid rempah (spice blend / paste) and this should stand out in all dishes<br&gt;2. It has to be delicious <br&gt;3. It has to feel like it&amp;#39;s prepare with love <br&gt;4. It has to warm the soul <br&gt;<br&gt;Nonya Chap Chye ($14.90)<br&gt;After the trying so many variations of Chao Chye, from Singapore to Malacca, from home cooked to higher end restaurants, I can proudly say that this Chap Chye is up there with the best. The bean curd skin taste is not overpowering and compliments the natural sweetness of the cabbage very well and the vegetables are soft yet not overcooked to mush. Really delicious. <br&gt;<br&gt;Assam Fish Curry ($11.90)<br&gt;Wow..... just wow! <br&gt;What&amp;#39;s great about this Assam is that it&amp;#39;s not overly spicy but it packs a punch. <br&gt;Be warned, the first bite might feel a bit overpowering, with an explosion of sourness, tanginess and slight sweetness, with each bite feeling like mini fireworks going off in the mouth but as you keep eating, the flavours mellow down, leaving a nice, almost soothing after taste in the mouth. <br&gt;<br&gt;Beef Rendang ($14.90)<br&gt;Another dish cooked with a lot of care and love. The sauce was slightly on the spicy side (very spicy to the wife who&amp;#39;s a non-chilli eater) but it certainly packed a punch. The sauce was fragrant and rich without being overpowering. Once the initial spiciness cleared, the rempah came through, showcasing the fragrant spices used, mixed in with the beefiness from stewing the Rendang. Most importantly was the beef. It was cooked to perfection. Wonderfully tender, the meat fell off the fork while we were trying to pick it up. Another very well executed dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ayam Buah Keluak ($16.90 + $5.00 for 2 seeds of Buah Keluak)<br&gt;My holy grail of Nonya Cuisine. My biggest weakness and most absolute must have for any Peranakan Restaurant and the ones here have the best Buah Keluak I&amp;#39;ve had..... ever! <br&gt;Firstly, it&amp;#39;s interesting how they used a mixture of Pork Ribs and Chicken instead of just solely chicken. The proteins were cooked perfectly, juicy and tender. Interestingly, because we took away, they actually separated the protein from the Buah Keluak. This gave us the chance to taste the rempah separately and again, it was very good. Fragrant and very tasty, the sauce acted as an enhancement to the protein and not over power it but the spotlight definitely goes to the Buah Keluak. Removed from the shells, blended smooth and re-stuffed, the Buah Keluaks tasted almost like a paté, packed with that rich, delicious black gold. <br&gt;<br&gt;Should you want the more familiar style of Ayam Buah Keluak, feel free to mix it both together. We did that eventually and the thick, black yumminess of the Buah Keluak helped elevate the rempah to another level. 2 thumbs and 2 toes up for me! <br&gt;<br&gt;Nonya Rice Dumpling ($3.90 at TANGS Marketplace) <br&gt;Ma little pricy in terms of rice dumplings (maybe because it&amp;#39;s TANGS). I have to admit, my favourite is still Kim Choo but that could just be me being bias. However, it still was a pretty good Nonya Zhang. The rice is not as fragrant and tasty as other I&amp;#39;ve tried but it did compliment the filling well, ensuring that the sweetness, saltiness and juiciness of the filling took centre stage. <br&gt;<br&gt;Pineapple Tarts ($19.00 - we think)<br&gt;First bite? We were disappointed. The pastry wasn&amp;#39;t as buttery or flavourful as some of the other tarts we&amp;#39;ve tried but once we reached the filling we understood why. The filling was very very good. The Palm sugar shone through and there was a richness and depth to it that a lot of other pineapple filling didn&amp;#39;t have. It felt like it was prepared the traditional way, stewing hours in a copper pot and allowing the sweetness, tartness and spices to blend into a yummy, gooey mix. <br&gt;<br&gt;On a whole, we loved the vibe of the restaurant and the food was way above expectations!"

Always one of my favorite local dishes for its craftiness, where an almost overwhelmingly bold sauce is paired with tofu, cucumber and sprouts, inherently bland tasting elements.  Pure genius!<br&gt;<br&gt;Nonya Ngoh Hiang.  Makko&amp;#39;s version of this local Teochew classic is lightly crunchy on the outside, filled with juicy morsels of minced meat and has a nice aromatic spiciness to balance all the gravidity of this deep-fried meat spring roll wrapped in tofu skin.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken Wings.  These are deep-fried as well in a batter that confers on each morsel a thick armored plating of screamingly hot, crunchy, spicy, gingery, greasy, juicy goodness.  I cannot thick of a better arch-nemesis to Korean-style fried chicken which has skin that is almost painted on and air light. I recommend having these fresh with a cold beer where you can slowly pick apart every bit of the wing and enjoy every spicy, crunchy bit of armor plating.  The subtle yellow ginger flavor suffusing every bite is pure genius."

Had a nice brunch at this quaint place in the midst of an office campus. It was a good 10 minutes, unshaded walk from Tanglin Road into a mixed use campus. So on a hot day, that air con is gonna feel extra nice when you step into the cool dining room. There is also outdoor seating in the back but it looked like stuff was being stored there when I took a peek.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food was nicely presented but more importantly, it was very tasty and exceeded my expectations after having some disappointing brunches lately. The food quality was very fresh and appealing. Highlights were the fluffy scrambled eggs and the sweet cherry tomatoes served slightly grilled and still the vine. Service was good and prompt, but oddly the coffee ordered arrived halfway through the meal. The server did apologize for the delay and said it was &amp;#34;due to the coffee being recalibrating&amp;#34; ... I&amp;#39;m not sure what that meant, but it&amp;#39;s quite possible I heard incorrectly. Nevertheless, great flat white. <br&gt;<br&gt;There&amp;#39;s a little boutique shop in-house selling jewelry, clothing, and accessories that&amp;#39;s worth a browse. Didn&amp;#39;t get to try the selection of desserts, but the server did offer. It&amp;#39;s going to have to be a rain check because there was just no more belly room."

Coffee was straightforward no complaints. Lychee tea was refreshing. Truffle fries served hot but not enough truffle. Some of the staff are young and inexperienced but quite eager to please which makes up for a lot.<br&gt;<br&gt;My 3rd time to this place. Friend&amp;#39;s bday impromptu brunch. We were seated on the verandah out at the back and it was a warm day but we felt cool enough and it was nice to have the greenery. The odd ant but hey when in jungle, swing from tree.<br&gt;<br&gt;Bday girl Emma J and I got to the scene first. We ordered the truffled mushroom on house baked baguette and french toast to share. Mushrooms were great with creamy rich sauce, lots of truffle flavour and scent and the baguette looked homemade and was chewy, tasty with a darker brown crust than usual. This looked so good that our late-comer friends all picked from it.<br&gt;<br&gt;French toast - served with some kinda caramel sauce and chantilly cream. The cream held itself together well despite the hot day. The toast was a thick cut of brioche, I think about 5 inch square. The rest of us dipped the fries in the caramel sauce but Emma J was horrified. We all liked this.<br&gt;<br&gt;Truffle fries. Not much on the truffle flavour again but a generous portion served piping hot and crisp.<br&gt;<br&gt;Friend ordered the big breakfast - all commented that the croissant was much smaller than expected. It really was a mini croissant. But the brek came with 2 big juicy sausages. Perhaps they are going low carb...Personally prefer if this came with a good sized piece of toast. Eggs were nicely cooked, soft layered and seasoned just right.<br&gt;<br&gt;Breakfast mains mostly $19 to $21. We all commented that the food was tasty and seemed like quality ingredients. Pleasing and with some nice bits but I wouldn&amp;#39;t travel far for it.<br&gt;<br&gt;We also ordered chicken wings to share - these came in a sauce that one friend described as zingy. Served hot, crispy - the sauce was bit spicy. Comfort food but yummier if you dip.<br&gt;<br&gt;Foam on my flatwhite was a little flat with some big bubbles so it didn&amp;#39;t have that velvety smoothness that some of the serious boys and girls serve up. I think coffee for is me is a 3 or 3.5. But yes the free parking, breezy white look, bit off the beaten track and so near where I stay. If i need a quick cuppa, I would come..clearly I did.<br&gt;<br&gt;They serve a lemon meringue tart which I&amp;#39;ve had on my first visit but found it a tad sweet. Ok crust."

Didn&amp;#39;t bother to look at the menu, as I feel to operate a cafe, a good coffee is always necessary. So I got myself a iced latte and a cappuccino. Took a whiff of the coffee, and it was strong. I remembered I had something so strong was back when I was in Greece. <br&gt;<br&gt;But once you mix in the milk and the espresso together. It became a symphony of flavours. The coffee they use are a little more towards the acidic side. I love the flavours that linger in my mouth. <br&gt;<br&gt;For me this is indeed one of the best coffees in Singapore. And what I love is that this is a no frills place. No pretentious staff and decor. It&amp;#39;s nice, pleasant on the eyes and it relaxes my soul! Yes!

The fact that this place is just a 7-min drive from my home, questions my sanity. Every time my car stops at the stoplight at the T-junction facing Siglap V, I contemplate. &amp;#34;Should I go? Should I not go?&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;I have read too many positive reviews about the café that it made me super curious and intrigued. So yes. Curiosity finally slaughtered the cat in me. I gave in and went today; along with my two willing colleagues.<br&gt;<br&gt;Why didn&amp;#39;t I come here sooner? Why? Why?!! Every single thing we ordered were brilliant. I ordered a glass of their Butterscotch Latte, whilst the rest of the food were shared amongst us three. We ordered Cinnamon Churros Ice Cream, Milo Dinosaur Waffles and Salted Caramel Pavlova. Fwoah!! If that&amp;#39;s not enough sugar rush for you, I don&amp;#39;t know what will.<br&gt;<br&gt;I think these were the best churros I&amp;#39;ve had so far. They tasted really crunchy and authentic. You could really taste the perfect cinnamon flavour. They were served in a glass with a scoop of chocolate-drizzled vanilla ice-cream in between.<br&gt;<br&gt;As for the pavlova, I opted it since I saw the words, &amp;#39;Salted Caramel&amp;#39; plastered onto it. I love salted caramel. Watching the staff cut a slice off the pavlova with a big knife was an enthralling watch. Haha! My colleague and I had our eyes glued. The meringue was baked into perfection. Even the caramel was brilliant.<br&gt;<br&gt;Moving onto our chocolate waffle, this was served to us the last. Firstly, I have to applaud on the presentation. Loved the mini marshmallows that were used as toppings. So cute! They had a dollop of vanilla ice-cream in the middle, topped with Milo powder. Another thumbs-up from all of us. Although, one of my colleagues commented that it would have been nicer if the waffle was a bit spongier.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, we loved the desserts. All of us ended up feeling contented after the sugary meal; no thanks to the stress at work. The service too was commendable. The lovely staff girls were all very friendly and considerate enough to tell us that the cakes are all Halal (supplied by a young local Malay baker, Farah H. Affandi -- go google her cake creations!).<br&gt;<br&gt;And oh! Parking slots are available at 3 convenient places. You may either park your vehicles at the basement carpark of the building itself, the lots behind the building, or the basement carpark at Siglap Centre located right across.<br&gt;<br&gt;For now, I think a hot glass of green tea is in order!"

The Flat White ($4.50) tasted strong and firm, yet has a low acidity that everyone can enjoy.<br&gt;<br&gt;The bakes and pastries here are supplied by online bakery Fathiscakes and Bonheur Pattiserie. The Salted Caramel Popcorn ($8.90), one of the cakes baked by Fathiscakes, is firm and satisfying. The caramel taste is just right; flavourful and not too sweet. Add a pinch of salt with popcorns on every mouthful and this will became a delightful cake to have.<br&gt;<br&gt;The location also meant that it is a quiet respite for people to relax with a cup of coffee or to study in during the day. With its reopening, the Siglap / East Coast area has now yet another cafe to be added to its list."

I actually visited Craftsmen Specialty Coffee at Siglap V, just opposite Siglap Centre, when they first opened (that was months back). Well, it took this long because well.. it&amp;#39;s just another cafe... who gets its beans from somewhere else, and in this case from Dutch Colony Coffee Co., which opened its outpost a few streets down... And as the story goes....<br&gt;<br&gt;First, the coffee. The Craftsmen blend is 40% El Salvador Finca El Carmen, 30% Ethiopia Konga natural Yirgacheffe and 30% Sumatra Triple Picked Mandheling. You get balanced notes with a hint of ripe lemon and dark chocolate finish. The coffee was bold and robust, just the way i like it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Drinks are in the $4-$5 range. Our latte and flat white were both $4.50 each. To differentiate itself, Craftsmen also has a brew bar which does V60, Chemex, Siphon, Woodneck and French Press coffees ($6-$8).  You can also get your hands on the usual coffee making products- Hario, Bodum blahblah.<br&gt;<br&gt;Food wise, we weren&amp;#39;t impressed. Quiches ($9) and sandwiches ($15-16) are made in house. We had the Pulled Pork sandwich ($15), which was MEH. The meat wasn&amp;#39;t seasoned well. It tastes of meat that&amp;#39;s bland and tough. Where&amp;#39;s the spice man? The choice of bread was also kinda off with a thin waxy brown skin and a strange center with a chewy pull. Well because the meat was so dry, it remained separated from the bread.<br&gt;<br&gt;Thankfully, they chose the right cake and pastry supplier, Fathis, who apparently supplies to many cafes (i can&amp;#39;t be sure of that) but anyhoo, i was thoroughly impressed with their moist and chunky banana walnut bread with a dollop of of cream cheese frosting. Other cakes available include a Salted Caramel Popcorn and Blueberry Cheesecake, and they look really hearty!<br&gt;<br&gt;So well, head over to Craftsmen for coffee and a piece of cake if you&amp;#39;re in the area. After all, it beats having the usual Coffee Club mudpie, or Udders ice cream."

The cake was moist and soft and full of gula melaka goodness. <br&gt;<br&gt;The only drawback was the fact that they do not serve water at all.

One of the most value for money sticky date pudding I&amp;#39;ve had and the portion and taste is awesome! The way the sticky date pudding is served is also rather different from any others out there. You have the ice cream sandwiched between 2 slices of cake and the sauce around. A good way to have a spoonful of all the goodies in one mouth. <br&gt;<br&gt;They also serve half portions for pasta and sandwiches. Check with the server to get more info on that. <br&gt;<br&gt;Do note that it&amp;#39;s really crowded during meal times so go during off peak to enjoy your meal in peace.

It was very small. The vanilla ice cream was alright, better than your Walls but not as good as Haagen Dazs.<br&gt;<br&gt;========================<br&gt;<br&gt;Jan 2017<br&gt;<br&gt;Caprese sandwich - 3.5 stars<br&gt;The mozzarella didn&amp;#39;t have much flavor or richness, the basil didn&amp;#39;t taste very fresh, and the tomatoes lacked flavor too. The focaccia was good, and the fries were pretty crispy and spicy but I don&amp;#39;t like fries much.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Marmalade Club - 3.5 stars<br&gt;A little better than the one above because the ingredients were naturally more tasty - egg, ham and I think what was a chicken salad. Came with sweet potato fries, which was a nice addition.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ambience 3.5 stars<br&gt;It was a pretty quiet and nice place for lunch but too dim to work at."

The recent experience totally made up for an earlier visit where I was slightly disappointed with the pork chop that felt rather stiff, perhaps overcooked.

Got easy seating about 6pm but it did start to fill up after 6:45pm. They did offer us happy hour on drinks. We ordered the Chicken stuffed with sundried tomatoes and spinach served with a buttery whire cream sauce and a side of carrots, potatoes and asparagus. The dish was divine. The chicken was seasoned so well and it was moist and everything was cooked perfectly. Also ordered the sweetpotatoes and pork belly and again everything was cooked well and we scraped our plates. For dessert we ordered the pear bread pudding with vanilla icecream and it was one of the best desserts I had in a long time.  I took pictures of both. Singapore has not disappointed us with the food. Everything is packed with flavor but this little gem gave us that nice meal we wanted without breaking the bank and just downstairs.

Tucked away at the end of the row of shops including Haato and E-Sarn at Ridgewood Close Condominium, I would not have known about it myself if a friend hadn&amp;#39;t brought me there. Valle is a nondescript neighbourhood bar, but don&amp;#39;t let appearances fool you. The bar is stocked with a smorgasboard of beers, ciders and ales from all over the world. I was shocked and delighted to find Paulaner Munich on tap for $12 a pint. In fact, all the drinks are priced super reasonably. You can get Rekordlig for $12 compared to the $15 you usually see it sold for at the bars in town. You can refer to this page <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.valle.com.sg%2Ffullmenu.html&amp;amp;s=ec5330c1c18a2a22149b8bc75e763fc8ee09006bfcd73b4434c79941498afea8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""&gt;valle.com.sg/fullmenu.ht…</a&gt; for the incredibly comprehensive menu. The prices listed are delivery prices (yes, they offer delivery) but I believe the prices at the bar are $1 or $2 more. Needless to say, if you&amp;#39;re an avid beer drinker, you will really like Valle. I also like the low key and casual vibe of the place. It really is your friendly neighbourhood bar where you can hang out and with your friends while enjoying a really good beer. Sadly, I&amp;#39;ve heard that the condo management has been forcing Valle&amp;#39;s owner to revise the closing time earlier and earlier. While they used to close at midnight, they now have to close at 10pm, I&amp;#39;m guessing because of residents&amp;#39; complaints. This is probably why Valle&amp;#39;s happy hour ends at 6 as the owner wants to encourage people to visit in the day. I do think Valle would be a really nice spot for a quiet afternoon drink as well."

They weren&amp;#39;t very hospitalable and much to our surprise, clueless about the beverages and menu. I asked our server how dry or sweet the bottle of champagne we are ordering and she looked at me like I was speaking alien. So I asked if it was brut or demisec. She says not brut but sure enough when the bottle came it was brut. For some reason I felt like they looked down on me and my sister. Never have I ever felt so different in a restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;DRINKS:<br&gt;<br&gt;cocktails were excellent and the sparkling/ champagne were great for the price.<br&gt;<br&gt;DESSERTS:<br&gt;<br&gt;Recap<br&gt;I had the Zen menu and my sister had the playful menu.<br&gt;<br&gt;Plating wise, it was a hit and miss. <br&gt;The pistachio and stone desserts looked great while the matcha tart looked terrible, pretty nice quenelle tho (even tho there was a gaping hole on its side) and so on and so forth.<br&gt;<br&gt;Flavors<br&gt;The taste is what the menu says.

It is easy to miss in its nondescript building with its sign in the window. Come here for the final course of the evening: dessert. It is an impressive collection of sweet treats that are a beautiful end to an evening. Skip the dinner items and the service leaves a lot to be desired. <br&gt;<br&gt;We should have gone to another local restaurant in the neighborhood for dinner. The savory dishes were rather lackluster. Everything we ordered seemed to be missing a final touch to make it a good dish. The mac and cheese lacked the truffle essence while the popcorn chicken seemed dry. The tacos were alright, while the sliders were simple and make you say &amp;#34;i&amp;#39;ve had better.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;The desserts are the showpiece and the reason you come here. The selection is pretty impressive and go with a group if you are willing to share and get a bite from each. The churros were pretty fantastic, especially with the hot chocolate dipping pot. Cheesecake was light but offered a pretty nice contrast in flavors from the baileys and the passion fruit, while the chocolate pop-rocks cake was a nice play on a childhood favorite.<br&gt;<br&gt;The ambiance is rather dark and contemporary. It comes across rather cold and a throwback to a 90s design aesthetic. Its ok, but not something you your mom and dad would appreciate. Service was rather uncomfortable and they seemed to lack a confidence in their knowledge of the menu while they watched to the point where you couldn&amp;#39;t really chat with your friends. At the end of it, the ambiance and service present a feeling: cold and unwelcomed."

The desserts are way over-hyped in my opinion and priced far beyond what they&amp;#39;re worth. The churros and hot chocolate were the best dish we had but were nevertheless underwhelming and exceedingly bitter. The chocolate forest dessert was such an odd selection of flavours it was impossible to discern what the goal was. It is almost as if so much is attention to distinguishing the look of the dishes that the flavour profile is just sort of thrown together. I am sad to say this feels like a place seeming high-class by making its dishes rather obscure just for the sake of appearance.

I was actually so excited to visit this place on my trip to Singapore but sadly, it didn&amp;#39;t fulfill my sweet tooth.

I think I had too high expectations which did not translate well. <br&gt;<br&gt;Chocolate H2O: ($22) Once again, presentation 10/10. It was on the dark side and tasted the same (like dark chocolate) throughout. The texture was nice but it didn&amp;#39;t wow. Every bit was mushy like mousse. I don&amp;#39;t know why I thought it would be layers of different flavors. The yuzu sorbet on the side was lovely though. <br&gt;<br&gt;Strawberry capresse: ($24) Quite liked this one. It was my favorite because I like yogurt and strawberry, and it tasted like both! Presentation was a 10/10 like usual. My friend was not impressed since it tasted like strawberry ice cream with strawberries and tapioca on top.<br&gt;<br&gt;Churros &amp;amp; hot chocolate +extra: ($15) the churros were nice, but the hot chocolate tasted like bitter milk to me. The chocolate taste itself was not very strong, and I think they could have added more chocolate. <br&gt;<br&gt;Cheesecake: ($17) My friends all loved this one. Enough said.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you like fancy desserts with a more expensive cost, then yes, this is a place for you. Presentation was a 10/10 for me, and I do believe the desserts took a long time to make since they were beautiful. However, my friends and I were not impressed with the taste. The atmosphere was super chill and upscale, like a more expensive bar. The location was a little bit hard to find, and portions are small. If I had the chance, I would come back and give it another try since I usually try things twice before I decide my true opinion on it."

I&amp;#39;ve heard so much of 2am dessert bar in the last few years that I&amp;#39;m amazed I never actually went. Today being singapore&amp;#39;s 50th, I simply had to honour the day with a little patriotism and find out what all the fuss (about chef Janice Wong) is about. <br&gt;<br&gt;Since I&amp;#39;m sure there are plenty of reviews on this place, I&amp;#39;m going to write this one a little differently. Here are some things I&amp;#39;ve heard and my opinion:<br&gt;1. Overpriced, atas, not worth the price: I&amp;#39;ll admit it is expensive but tonight was the first night my hippie of a boyfriend said an expensive high end place I brought him to was worth the price and he&amp;#39;d bring his parents someday. This is the first among a string of award-winning, rave-reviews-earning restaurants around parts of the world we&amp;#39;ve lived in or travelled to. So, you can decide for yourself if it is overpriced after trying it out too! The chances are that you&amp;#39;ll come to the same conclusion as us. There is a minimum spending per person on certain days though!<br&gt;2. Tacky: I don&amp;#39;t know what classifies as tacky anymore, what with the hipsters thinking everything is tacky if it is not old in a cool way, so if you ask me, this place is about as cool as it gets. It has a nice bar vibe without being too noisy or busy.<br&gt;3. Overhyped: Chef Janice Wong is good, quite simply put. I didn&amp;#39;t believe I could be so in love with every dish I had but I am. I wish I could be her, making pretty confectionery and insanely creative food installations.<br&gt;<br&gt;The great positives that earned that last star on the review:<br&gt;1. They mixed up our order and gave us a free tart. We ordered the green tea tart, and they gave us the chocolate tart on the house. They could easily have taken it back, but I&amp;#39;m glad they did not because it was good and I&amp;#39;ll go back for more now.<br&gt;2. The wine/cocktail pairings were quite on point. A rich chocolate dessert balanced with sorbet and served with a decent red wine was just such a great combination. <br&gt;3. They apologised for any inconsistency even though we would never have known or minded anyway. These apologies included the different plate used from the norm for one dish and change in flavour of the cocktail. <br&gt;4. Interesting and well-paired flavours in each dish ensured that my impression wasn&amp;#39;t marred by the fact that one dish was simply too weird, boring or terrible. The lavender marshmallows were subtle but still had a hint of lavender, ideal for such a strong flavour, while the strong matcha was lightened by the rice sorbet and the dark chocolate was made less intense and rich by the evian.<br&gt;5. They have $5 churros that were actually decent and tasted like what you&amp;#39;d get in Europe. Enough said.<br&gt;6. The very friendly staff were constantly smiling and made us feel really welcome and comfortable. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you have never tried this place, I&amp;#39;d strongly recommend heading down maybe for a special occasion if you can&amp;#39;t justify the spending. The place is small but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s too busy. Even on sg50 night, we didn&amp;#39;t have to wait for seats. There isn&amp;#39;t a dress code either thankfully, and is very aptly relaxed and friendly; I wouldn&amp;#39;t call it too posh at all!"

The chef-owner Janice had won numerous awards for her pastry creations. However, there seemed to be less positive reviews than negative ones. <br&gt;<br&gt;Some felt that the quality/portions of the desserts did not justify the expensive price tag while some felt the service was lacking. Finally mustered the necessary courage to visit and well, our experience was not fantastic but not too bad.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Red Miso Caramel ($15) with mustard crumble sparked my curiosity as saltish desserts often excelled better than purely sweet desserts. The miso lemon foam was robust enough to pair with the slightly tangy mustard yuzu meringue, though my partner found the match rather odd. <br&gt;<br&gt;This interesting dessert would not dull your taste buds, even though the mustard taste was faint. <br&gt;<br&gt;This Southeast Asian style dessert is named &amp;#34;Shades of Green&amp;#34; ($14) had nothing to do with trees but 2Ps--pistachio and pandan. The pistachio sponge and coconut mousse were quite forgettable, but what I remembered was the sweet and aromatic pandan gula melaka custard. Overall not too dense nor overly sweet. If you like kaya toasts or nyonya kuehs like ondeh ondeh just like me, you might love this one<br&gt;<br&gt;There was a petite tasting menu, from which we ordered the sticky toffee pudding. But at $10 for a small slice, it was pricy and I should have stuck to the regular menu.<br&gt;<br&gt;With some wacky combinations of ingredients, I would not say that the desserts are extremely overpriced but more or less, on par with most western restaurants and even cafes here.<br&gt;<br&gt;At least they are not boring repetitions of molten lava cake, creme brulee or apple crumble. That said, don&amp;#39;t be like me who wanted to save money by ordering the cheaper petite tasting creations.

I certainly thought it was on par with many of the innovative, deconstructed desserts I&amp;#39;ve had at good (and expensive) full-fledged restaurants (as opposed to this slip of a place serving up only drinks and sweet constructions) - which already puts it at an enviable standard. whether she&amp;#39;s the best pastry chef in asia - that&amp;#39;s certainly subjective.<br&gt;<br&gt;it was an experience observing the action at the bar counter in full view of the plating action. the restaurant has bar seating, slouchy couch type seats (reserve these if you must, as these go quickly) and high tables - the first and second best for couples, the latter good for groups.<br&gt;<br&gt;it&amp;#39;s an interesting concept, as you realize the chef doesn&amp;#39;t really do much interaction with guests (which is often the point of bar seating), but instead spends the time speeding back and forth getting her components ready since she&amp;#39;s running the show solo (waiters aside).<br&gt;<br&gt;we took two desserts: the mediterranean (olive oil ganache, white peach and rosemary) and the kayambe h2o (a chocolate connection of frozen dark chocolate mousse).<br&gt;<br&gt;they both arrived as works of art - it&amp;#39;s undeniable the effort that must go into the preparation of the individual components, and you certainly see the involved plating involved - but after such an incredible wait, our experience was tempered both by impatience and hunger.<br&gt;<br&gt;but both plates were delicious, and definitely special. it&amp;#39;s a level of dining you&amp;#39;d expect in a five star establishment as part of a kitchen filled with patissiers and sous chefs running about, not in a tiny bar in holland village. the mediterranean especially for the rosemary air - which was some sort of slightly frozen, melt-in-the-mouth confection that was incredibly savory (and yet not out of place on a sweet plate) - though not to forget mentioning that every component played well together (I would go so as as to suggest rationing components out so they last till you finish).<br&gt;<br&gt;but service is slow, desserts aren&amp;#39;t cheap - so it&amp;#39;s best for a date night, not a dessert pig-out."

I still think Ubin Kitchen on Joo Chiat Road holds the title for best classic bao in SG!

The meringue came as the topping in the shape of rose, the rest of the ingredients were lemon sponge, lemon curd and vanilla ice cream with almond slices.

Perfect for some catching up as its quiet and not crowded for most of the time, according to another Yelper. <br&gt;<br&gt;Orders are self service and free wifi is available but you have to ask the staff for the password. It would be nice if they could leave the password either on the table or on the receipt. Staff were friendly and more importantly no sign of impatience or pressure to leave the cafe even though the group had finish the food for quite some time and got lost in the wonderful conversation. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Namban Chicken and Classic (check my photo of the menu for more information) and I find them to be my liking for my taste bud. Not the best but decent enough for me to make another trip back to try out the other flavours. Prices is reasonable and portion is definitely value for money. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, this is a great cafe for catching up and enjoying the &amp;#34;bao&amp;#34;! Do drop by if you are nearby or have a craving for &amp;#34;Bao&amp;#34;."

Lastly, their truffle fries were a bit on the salty side, but full of cheesy truffley goodness. <br&gt;<br&gt;Besides the food, the decor is right up my alley. Clean and modern, wide open spaces and gray and brown accents. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was super fast, which is another big plus with places that have small menus.

Ordered an Ice- Latte to start, 5 minutes later its done and i have to say its really pretty good. Being at a Bao place. You&amp;#39;ve got to try the baos right? so i went straight for the shrimp with salted egg yolk one. The bummer was that it was a minimum order of 2 baos, and i really had wanted to sit down and relax and not stuff myself with 2 baos. But i understand the procedure as steaming just one bao would be quite a waste of steam i suppose. so i had to go for the traditional one. The classic &amp;#34;kong bak&amp;#34; bao/pork belly. The shrimp one could do with a more stronger salted egg yolk sauce, but all in all, the shrimp was fresh and crisp. As for the pork belly bao, it would be nice if it had a thicker sauce around the meat. <br&gt;<br&gt;The staff here are friendly and would go the extra mile to help. So the next time you&amp;#39;re around horne road or going to catch a soccer match at the jalan besar stadium. Come over and get yourself a great cup of coffee and some baos.

Describing styles of furniture isn&amp;#39;t my strong suit, but I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s a mix of modern and vintage, and totally my type. The couches and bed frames remind me of the styles you would see at a West Elm.<br&gt;<br&gt;Since I&amp;#39;m not in the market to buy any big-ticket items, I decided to check out their smaller home accessories. I fell in love with one their wine bottle racks, and I believe it was pretty affordable at around $90.

Literally the BEST place that I recommend any of my health loving friends to visit in Singapore.<br&gt;<br&gt;First off - the staff are so friendly. I would come here to eat lunch everyday in Singapore if I could. They are just so bright and cheery. The ambience is very chilled and laid back and the food is wonderful. There is no booking so if you&amp;#39;re coming for a weekend brunch, I would recommend coming early because the place does fill up very fast.<br&gt;<br&gt;There is a lot on offer to order on the menu and I feel there is something for everyone. If you&amp;#39;re vegan then this is heaven on earth but if you&amp;#39;re not, you won&amp;#39;t think your friend has just brought you into hell either. There are burgers and meats on the menu but I feel The Living Cafe has gone out of its way to offer the best quality food possible for each category. No hidden nasties here.<br&gt;<br&gt;They also have a big fridge filled of yummy raw treats! I remember how excited I was to find The Living Cafe in Singapore after having discovered raw treats in the US and the UK. This place had become Utopia. <br&gt;<br&gt;Upstairs you will find a huge selection of books which make excellent additions to any food lovers library. They also sell bits and bobs that health freaks (me) in Singapore generally have a hard time finding such as Bee Pollen, Coconut Oil, Spiralizer, Vitamix..<br&gt;<br&gt;Even if you&amp;#39;re not that &amp;#39;into&amp;#39; being healthy I would definitely give this place a go to see what its all about. And if you&amp;#39;re brave enough, try one of their Wheatgrass shots. Take them instead of Tequila. Same bitterness but the after effect out weighs it, I assure you! ;)."

Easy music and free wi-if make it a good relaxing spot as well. <br&gt;<br&gt;They offer multiple deserts and food for dinning in or to-go.

I thought of it as a cousin to Cafe Gratitude. <br&gt;<br&gt;I started off with a Pure Green (wheatgrass, celery, spinach, parsley). It&amp;#39;s a drink for those who chase after nutrients as opposed to flavor. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Zucchini Pesto Pasta also tasted healthy. It&amp;#39;s for those who enjoy bland dishes. I am one of those people so I liked it. <br&gt;<br&gt;The desserts and smoothies are sweet. Try the yummy Spirulina Mintball. The mint is the superstar ingredient. The heart-shaped cookies made of dehydrated raspberries were an unguilty pleasure. The Chocolate Monkey (cashew milk, banana, dates, cacao) made a delightfully filling post-dessert. <br&gt;<br&gt;Will definitely be coming back to Living Cafe for more nutritious goodies!"

In fact, if I&amp;#39;m not wrong, The Living Cafe is the only of it&amp;#39;s kind so far here in Singapore (if someone knows of another raw cafe, please let me know!)<br&gt;<br&gt;The Living Cafe specializes in food that nourishes your body, from the inside out. Most of their menu is raw (meaning, they are all raw vegan foods that have not been heated above 115 degrees fahrenheit in order to preserve it&amp;#39;s nutrients). I know, sounds like they&amp;#39;d only serve salads, correct? Wrong. <br&gt;<br&gt;My favorites on the menu include their Zucchini Pesto Pasta (note: this isn&amp;#39;t actually pasta but zucchini shredded to look like spaghetti and pesto sauce homemade uses herbs and nuts), their Raw Lasagne, Raw Vegetable soups (cold - perfect for a hot day), their Living Rolls (rice paper rolls), Tofu Avocado Rolls, Raw Zucchini Dip (with Flaxseed crackers to dip) and not forgetting their AMAZING AMAZING raw/gluten/refined sugar free desserts. Honestly, the desserts in itself make a trip down here worth it (imagine tiramisu that actually tastes like tiramisu but made solely out of coconut, dates, nuts and other whole ingredients that give you a sugar fix WITHOUT the sugar high)<br&gt;<br&gt;I love raw foods for it&amp;#39;s long term benefits as well as for how good it makes me feel right away, however, making raw foods is truly an art and without the proper knowledge and creative skills, you&amp;#39;d end up eating salads everyday. The Living Cafe truly makes it easy to eat raw from time and time with their creativeness and amazing sauces that liven up otherwise tasteless vegetables. <br&gt;<br&gt;On top of that, service is very friendly and the space is nice (nice enough to sit all day with a book) with a small area for your kids to play while you enjoy lunch too. <br&gt;<br&gt;My advice? Go for lunch (they close for dinner), get dessert and take a look at their little store upstairs after (they sell things like the Vitamix, Raw Cacao, Chia Seeds, the Zucchini Pasta maker and much more!)"

It uses no red meat, no cow dairy, no white sugar, no preservatives, no additives, no artificial colorings and include gluten free alternatives. So if you are quick to spot the (loop)holes, this place is not entirely vegan, as it serves things like salmon and goat cheese.<br&gt;<br&gt;Starters were the hand-cut Sweet Potato Wedges ($4) that were earthy and good. Lightly baked with olive oil, it did not had the tempting smell of fries from fast food outlets but an alluring scent of coriander seeds. Some might find it rather firm but these were perfect for napping in the home-made mayonnaise (made of cashew nut milk, lemon juice, water, olive oil and salt but no egg yolks.)<br&gt;<br&gt;Follow that up with TLC cheese burger ($15): a dehydrated patty of portobello mushrooms, almonds and sunflower seeds, topped with tomatoes, sprouts and romaine lettuce. I stared in disbelief at the bun-less burger as those burgers from the opposite tables had buns and cheese.Though the mushroom patty had a robust aroma, it was tough and dry, not aided by an unidentified bland orange sauce Wished it was a simple grilled Portobello mushroom with garlicky herbs. But there were good things like the Mexican-inspired Raw Taco Boats ($12). My trepidations of greasy wheat glutens dissipated when the two large sized mock meat turned out to be made of dehydrated walnuts. <br&gt;<br&gt;The light guacamole and mango salsa sauce had a touch of Indian flavors, probably because this dish used similar spices such as cumin.  While the savoury food were wholesome, it was the RAW desserts that blown us away. Each had their own merits and everyone declared our own favourite item. <br&gt;<br&gt;I love the Raw Dark German Chocolate Cake ($8.50) made with Dates, Zucchini, Coconut oil, Cacao Powder, Irish Moss Honey and Macadamia. It was compact and chocolatey, not too sweet despite a toffee-lookalike honey layer on top. The shards of fragrant toasted coconuts were a bonus.<br&gt;<br&gt;As for the Raw Blueberry Cheesecake($8.50)made with coconut oil, agave, cashew and lemon juice, we could not be bothered by the alien-sounding ingredients such as psyllium husk, soy lecithin, Irish moss, as we dived straight into the delicate mousse and crunchy base. A bit of sweet and a bit of summer fruity flavours, we did not miss the sharp tang of cream cheese.<br&gt;<br&gt;Tiramisu (actually we all did)  was made of natural coffee extract and sitted on chalky and fragile almond-flour cake base. This is literally an authentic tiramisu sans the fats from Mascarpone Cheese and Raw Egg Yolks (Yes, tiramiusu is made of raw eggs too). And who says tiramisu must have the alcohol to taste good? Honestly, I left the place feeling more satisfied than I had expected (perhaps it&amp;#39;s due to eating &amp;#34;Real Food&amp;#34; ).<br&gt; <br&gt;However, the fact that nearly every dish were full of (grinded) NUTS, drove me nuts a little. Perhaps I would still pick Indian/Chinese style vegetarian food from Raj Restaurant over TLC.  <br&gt;<br&gt;That said, don&amp;#39;t leave without trying TLC&amp;#39;s desserts which had not been compromised on flavours.

Looks great and tastes refreshing but since it&amp;#39;s cold it can take some getting used to. For those craving something warm, go for the sweet potato wedges! Highly recommended. We had the chocolate ganache tart too but the taste of coconut overpowered any taste of chocolate but presentation was flawless.

I usually can&amp;#39;t get too full from just eating vegetables and had to order a number of items to feel satisfied here.<br&gt;<br&gt;We started with the living cafe roll, which contained an assortment of fresh vegetables, wrapped in daikon sheets and had two splotches of different sauces on the nicely-presented sides of our plate. While clearly fresh and juicy (and the creaminess of the avocado was a good complement to the fresh peppers and lettuce), I feel like the sauces needed to be either thicker or just marinated into the vegetables-- as I needed to dip my pieces several times to get a flavorful bite. And because there&amp;#39;s no real binding agent, the pieces also fall apart fairly easily, unless you put a whole piece into your mouth-- which can be a bit challenging.<br&gt;<br&gt;On the other hand, the raw zucchini lasagne was flavorful and fresh, but a bit small in its portion.<br&gt;<br&gt;I also ordered the acai kickstart, which was a very tasty balance of bananas, oats, honey and acai-- until you ate past the top inch and are left a bland layer of with frozen acai filling up the bottom 2/3 of the cup.<br&gt;<br&gt;Because I still wasn&amp;#39;t full after the three orders, we also had the poached fresh salmon-- which has pieces as small as you&amp;#39;d find in sushi nigiri and was clean and unsalted-- and the hand-cut sweet potato wedges-- which were huge potato segments (they used both the traditional orange sweet potato, along with a purple variety) that were pretty decently fried, without being oily.<br&gt;<br&gt;The flat white coffee with soy milk is pretty decent (although they had run out of the hazelnut milk that we had initially wanted to try).<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I wasn&amp;#39;t a huge fan of the place, but I think that it lives up to its concept and will please raw foodists and other healthy living enthusiasts in Singapore.<br&gt;<br&gt;Very nice, casual atmosphere too with very clean, polished setup. The crowd seemed to consist of a lot of Caucasian mothers who took/take prenatal yoga classes."

They provides fruit and veggie juices with ingredients that are hard to come by in many healthy restaurants I&amp;#39;ve been to. They have juices with coconut water, goji berries, cilantro, wheatgrass, etc., but they also add supplements to some of their juices like Vitamineral green, lecithin, maca powder, etc. Their smoothies and shakes are vegan, made with nut or rice milk, a refreshing change if you want to cut dairy out of your diet. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food menu, however, is not 100% vegetarian. They have chicken and fish on the menu from what I remember. The night I went, I had the TLC roll and the TLC Cheeseburger, both of which are vegetarian. The roll did have homemade mayo so I&amp;#39;m not sure if its totally vegan, but the quality of the ingredients are definitely very good. The price sort of matches that, reasonable. I paid $40 for a fruit and veggie juice, a roll, the cheeseburger and a vegan/gluten free chocolate cake.<br&gt;<br&gt;This place also sells supplements, tools to make things at home like a nut milk bag, mason jars and the like, as well as ingredients like salt, vanilla extract, palm sugar, etc. Not gunna lie though, those items were expensive and I know that I can get these same items for cheaper back in the states or even in other shops in Singapore."

My better half is also a gluten-free eater. Well I walked in on a Saturday morning and there was one table occupied. No one greeted me and so I figured I&amp;#39;ll just sit down and wait for service. 20 minutes later I was still ignored while another party came in, sat at the table at the back of the cafe and was waited on immediately. I also observed the same for the next two tables that walked in. The cynical part of me would say maybe I wasn&amp;#39;t the right skin color, but nice let&amp;#39;s-give-them-the-benefit-of-doubt side would argue maybe the service just is bad.<br&gt;<br&gt;So I got myself a menu and managed to order my food by getting one waiter&amp;#39;s attention. Service was better from there as said waiter was efficient in delivering the food, but that&amp;#39;s about it. I ordered the granola crunch bowl, pancakes and vegetarian omelet. When the food came, I got the same surprise I had a few months ago at the other cafe down the street, the LITTLE diner. Yup folks, small portions for not so small prices. And it was not like I was eating anything particularly unique or outstanding. The pancakes were on the rubbery side with a *sprinkle* of blue and strawberries and a sparse drizzle of what tasted like honey. The omelet was tasty and went well with the multi-grain bread but again, I felt kind of ripped off because this was easily something my mum could make, bigger and for cheaper.<br&gt;<br&gt;I guess this places is a convenient snack place after yoga class but I really wouldn&amp;#39;t make the effort to eat here otherwise. Onaka, 7 Sensations and even Whole Earth offer much better value considering the creativity that&amp;#39;s put into reinterpreting dishes, the portions and the quality of ingredients."

There was a raw mushroom soup I attempted - think uncooked mushrooms pureed into soup-like texture akin to Gazpacho with a really strong raw mushroom smell. I only managed one scoop of that. There are also raw pizzas and raw pastas (it&amp;#39;s sliced up zucchini!), and even cakes for those who like this sorta thing.<br&gt;<br&gt;Thankfully, there are options for the less refined palettes, I had a cooked pizza with a mysterious &amp;#34;cheesy&amp;#34; sauce, inverted commas and all. While cooked, it was healthier with a whole wheat base that reminded me of digestive biscuits, but overall quite yummy.<br&gt;<br&gt;Raw vegan food does come at a price though - the portions are not very big but the prices are still the pricey bistro sort. Also, make sure you have time because the food is all freshly prepared and takes quite awhile to come."

Don&amp;#39;t worry, they don&amp;#39;t expect you to dine a la neanderthal style, bloody meat and all. The raw part comes from the emphasis on raw vegan cuisine, no dairy or meat products, food cooked below 48deg Celsius. It&amp;#39;s all quite healthy really and of course the food would preserve more of the vitamins and nutrients when it&amp;#39;s not overheated. <br&gt;<br&gt;What I had was a special kiwi menu created by The Living Cafe but that kinda gave us the idea how food is prepared here. A lot of nuts are used, in making dehydrated crackers and tart base. It gives it a crunchy texture which I like. If you have allergies, pray stay away.<br&gt;<br&gt;There are also cooked food available and different cuisines as well. Italian and Thai are among them. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that intimidating trying raw food and I think TLC makes it really easy for you to forget its even raw in the first place.

A lor mee stall just opened, that&amp;#39;s not bad, though portions have been shrinking rapidly. The chicken rice store is also extremely popular, but I think it&amp;#39;s by virtue of being around super long, and growing into a habitual taste. It&amp;#39;s only so-so.

I usually spend 3h there, starting with meesiam (most would say it&amp;#39;s so-so only, but I like its super lightness :P), lormee/fishball noodles, carrot cake, giam tao roti and whatever else I feel like eating that day. It&amp;#39;s a super dynamic place. Some stalls come (watch out for even 1.50 promotions lol, happened a few times this year), some go, some branch out, the staples stay... not too many stalls that it&amp;#39;s overwhelming. Love this place. Also, they have some bazaar with stalls selling random stuff every month. May be the first or last Sunday, I always forget.<br&gt;<br&gt;Last, this is a morning place, some things sell out around noon. At night, there isn&amp;#39;t much accept those black/white noodles/lwayteow stalls.<br&gt;<br&gt;This place cannot be beat for price/location in Singapore. That I&amp;#39;m pretty certain. If you&amp;#39;re bored of the hawker center, there are foodcourts a stone&amp;#39;s throw away as well, but they are not as popular."

They keep it simple and sweet with the menu, with only a few mains and daily specials written on the board above the open kitchen. If you&amp;#39;re a glutton like me, who always wanted to try a little bit of everything, then &amp;#34;pimp your breakfast&amp;#34; might be your jam. You can order small plates to add on to your main course, eg sauteed mushroom ($5), smoked salmon ($6) and so forth. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had the toasted banana bread yesterday and it was so damn delicious. The price might be slightly expensive, selling at $14 piece, but it was all worth it. The banana bread is topped with toasted macadamia nuts, drizzle lightly with honey and sit in a pool of vanilla yogurt. My friend had the &amp;#34;toastie&amp;#34; and it was good too. Light, not too cloying with the right amount of filling. The toastie also comes with a side of fresh pickled salad (i think?).  And what&amp;#39;s brunch without coffee you ask? Lokal serves pretty good coffee from both my visits and had been consistent with the quality. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re planning to visit on a weekend, come early as the crowd can get overwhelming towards 1130-ish to 12pm. No reservation unfortunately so just walk in!"

I do like that you could pimp your breakfast (choose what you want) and you are not face with the same generic choices in so many cafes now. Just unfortunate those who had the sandwiches, burgers or breakfast selection did not enjoyed it. The sweet stuff like banana bread or brownie was rated good. I did try some of what the others ordered and they were ok, just not mindblown. The main discontent was the bacon which was very hard and chewy and tasty. Maybe we were used to the salty bacon from the supermarket or other places, and thus might not appreciate it when it was cured in-house? <br&gt;<br&gt;As I finally decided on the blueberry macadamia muffin and a flat white, I actually did enjoy my breakfast. The muffin was big in Asia&amp;#39;s standards, with a nice muffin top. I am used to Mmmarvellous Mmmuffins&amp;#39; type of muffins so most muffins won&amp;#39;t get me excited. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was good. I requested for my muffin to be heated up as it was cold and they actually gave me a new muffin. I had already sliced the muffin in half and took a bite before realizing it was cold. So kudos for that. The home made butter was nicely whipped and perfect on the muffin. It was not overly sweet though certain bites were sweeter than others, but overall I liked it. <br&gt;<br&gt;The flat white was so-so. Then again I am not a coffee connoisseur. The coffee was not creamy like other flat whites I had in other cafes. This version was lighter and the slight bitter taste was prominent. <br&gt;<br&gt;I may visit the place again as it does have a nice vibe and may be a good place to chill when it is less busy. Hopefully the savory food will be better another day too."

The bread was soft and moist and paired well with the yogurt and nuts, but was nothing extraordinary and was a bit steep for its price tag of $15. A plus point would be that it was not too sweet and hence rather easy on the palate. <br&gt;<br&gt;For dessert, the sticky date pudding was a pleasant end to the meal. In fact, I&amp;#39;d say skip the banana bread and have this instead. The sticky date pudding pairs well with the vanilla bean ice cream and the degree of sweetness depends on the amount of syrup you choose to dip your pudding in. Warm and sweet, it&amp;#39;d definitely satisfy those with a sweet tooth!<br&gt;<br&gt;The coffee was particularly disappointing. With beans from sarnies, it failed to provide the kick the usual Joe from sarnies does and lacked depth.

Taking the business name, it kind of already suggest that its more on the Local, more like internationally influenced style. They are located at a corner of the intersection of Bukit Pasoh and Neil Road where you can find Goethe Institue nearby. It&amp;#39;s quite easy to get here as they are within minutes walk from Outram MRT Station.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s causal and welcoming atmosphere had kind of remind me of a cafe in Edinburgh Bus Interchange. Interior was rustic with a hipster interior that keep up with the cafe trends in Singapore.<br&gt;<br&gt;We requested the coffee based dessert to be served first. This looks really cool with a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with shot of espresso.<br&gt;<br&gt;Affogato - $6.50<br&gt;<br&gt;While waiting for the food, I had a glass of chai latte. Chai fragrance was average and all was down in my stomach even before the food was served.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chai - $6.50<br&gt;<br&gt;Starters was good with 3 ways Cauliflower served on a traditional Chinese metal plate. Cauliflower comes in 3 different forms and beautifully presented. With puree as its base, stacked by leafy greens and cabbages with tumeric infused cauliflowers, fried cauliflowers, as well as Ricotta &amp;amp; almond makes it special. Recommended.<br&gt;<br&gt;Cauliflower 3 ways - $13<br&gt;<br&gt;Another starter we had was great and perhaps suitable for those who want a lighter meal instead. Roasted beet roots was juicy and mix with quinoa, green beans, blue cheese &amp;amp; honey walnuts. I&amp;#39;m not really a fan of blue cheese, fortunately, the taste of the blue cheese was not that strong as I would have thought.<br&gt;<br&gt;Roasted Beetroot Salad - $13<br&gt;<br&gt;Torn between the Braised beef cheek and Cape Grim Sirloin Tagliata, I end up with the latter as per recommended by the server for its popularity. Served on a wooden board with scrumptious beef cubes cover by watercress with Asiago cheese and cheery tomatoes pairing.<br&gt;<br&gt;Cape Grim Sirloin Tagliata - $28<br&gt;<br&gt;The beef were cut into cubes form cooked to the default perfection by the cafe. Simply love its charred exterior and the juicy tender mild bloody meat.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ending the session of the night with sticky date pudding as dessert on a good note. The warm pudding was velvety coupled with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream and yummy caramel sauce. The best part of the dessert was that with the sticky date and sauce, the entire dessert was not too cloying and one won&amp;#39;t feel the excess richness and sweetness in them.<br&gt;<br&gt;Sticky Date Pudding - $10<br&gt;<br&gt;As a whole, service was friendly with a good atmosphere around. Even though they have limited items on the menu, fred not as they have daily specials, so do check out what&amp;#39;s on their black board."

Bit rich for breakfast for me so I won&amp;#39;t order it unless I&amp;#39;m sharing.<br&gt;<br&gt;2) Pumpernickel bread and sourdough - The former is softer and served thinner. The sourdough tastes heartier and bit more rustic. Bread if you order on its own comes with 2 slices at $1.75. But order it for $6 and you get 3 slices of bread and unlimited and free choice of house-made butter, jams, peanut butter or vegemite. Bread slices size here is smaller than average cafe.<br&gt;<br&gt;I like vegemite and it&amp;#39;s an Aussie thing which suits this cafe which is opened by Darren Farr from Sydney. the peanut butter is unusual in that it&amp;#39;s very dark in colour and thick and tastes like sesame seed paste.<br&gt;<br&gt;3) Scrambled eggs here are creamy and buttery and fluffy. A big portion. $6<br&gt;<br&gt;4) I&amp;#39;ve had the ricotta (also housemade) a few times just with toast. $6<br&gt;<br&gt;5) Smoked salmon. Again this is done inhouse and hot smoked and a highlight.<br&gt;<br&gt;6) Coffee is from Common Man Roasters - 22 Martin Rd blend is the house blend but I always ask for the single origin as I do not like the 22 Martin one whether made at Common Man Roasters or here. No extra charge. $5<br&gt;<br&gt;Other things I like - There is free wifi. The place is quiet in the mornings on weekdays with ample parking right outside. I&amp;#39;ve been several times and seen Chef Farr there many times so it&amp;#39;s nice to have a place where the original chef owner is actually on the floor and in the kitchen regularly. In fact, this morning he sent over some of their (housemade of course) kaya and we all really liked it! More subtly flavoured with a light caramel taste.<br&gt;<br&gt;What&amp;#39;s missing for the last star. The place looks nice but the atmosphere of it isn&amp;#39;t quite that relaxed Aussie feel. The coffee if from the single origin tastes not bad but isn&amp;#39;t as good as Common Man Roaster&amp;#39;s rendition. I think it could be a little fresher. It&amp;#39;s kinda slow to come. Service can be up and down but I decided to review because recently I find that service has improved. They have some new staff that seem quite enthusiastic which is nice. They seem to take a bit long to get the bill ready even though it&amp;#39;s not that crowded on weekday mornings and some of us need to get to our real jobs!"

But to be honest, calling Lokal a cafe really doesn&amp;#39;t do the justice as its food standard is one of the highest in SG. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unlike the weekday mornings, the place was PACKED. They had a waiting list of people to be seated around 11:30am. But I was able to grab a seat at the chef&amp;#39;s counter and gawk at all the delicious foods that were coming freshly out of the kitchen and enjoy my food. <br&gt;<br&gt;I started off with English breakfast tea-- not bad, but nothing exceptional. But I wish there was an option to have the tea set out of the pot as the tea got way too bitter towards the end of my meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;Then I had the roasted pumpkin salad  (5/5 )which just AMAZED me. One of the best salad I&amp;#39;ve had. It&amp;#39;s flavorful without being drenched in dressing and just the right heartiness with well-cooked, yet still firm pupkin, healthy mix of quinoa and nuts, and fresh beans. It is definitely a must try.<br&gt;<br&gt;Then finished the meal with the chef&amp;#39;s first attempt at anzac cookies (4/5; Australian traditional cookies--made with coconut and oats) and my gosh. I&amp;#39;m generally not a huge fan of oat cookies, but this sweetness was just right. And for that I had to order a cup of long black (I&amp;#39;ve come to not call it Americano anymore while in Singapore) to go along. I was told the beans were roasted by Sarnies and the blend was created in-house, and was called fuzzy wuzzy (4.5/5). But boy did they do a good job. The aroma and the finishing note of the coffee well-complemented the cookie. <br&gt;<br&gt;Really aiming to come for dinner in the upcoming weeks."

I&amp;#39;m a fan. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been to Lokal a couple of times the past 6 months, both for brunch. They keep it simple and sweet with the menu, with only a few mains and daily specials written on the board above the open kitchen. If you&amp;#39;re a glutton like me, who always wanted to try a little bit of everything, then &amp;#34;pimp your breakfast&amp;#34; might be your jam. You can order small plates to add on to your main course, eg sauteed mushroom ($5), smoked salmon ($6) and so forth. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had the toasted banana bread yesterday and it was so damn delicious. The price might be slightly expensive, selling at $14 piece, but it was all worth it. The banana bread is topped with toasted macadamia nuts, drizzle lightly with honey and sit in a pool of vanilla yogurt. My friend had the &amp;#34;toastie&amp;#34; and it was good too. Light, not too cloying with the right amount of filling. The toastie also comes with a side of fresh pickled salad (i think?).  And what&amp;#39;s brunch without coffee you ask? Lokal serves pretty good coffee from both my visits and had been consistent with the quality. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re planning to visit on a weekend, come early as the crowd can get overwhelming towards 1130-ish to 12pm. No reservation unfortunately so just walk in!"

Bit rich for breakfast for me so I won&amp;#39;t order it unless I&amp;#39;m sharing.<br&gt;<br&gt;2) Pumpernickel bread and sourdough - The former is softer and served thinner. The sourdough tastes heartier and bit more rustic. Bread if you order on its own comes with 2 slices at $1.75. But order it for $6 and you get 3 slices of bread and unlimited and free choice of house-made butter, jams, peanut butter or vegemite. Bread slices size here is smaller than average cafe.<br&gt;<br&gt;I like vegemite and it&amp;#39;s an Aussie thing which suits this cafe which is opened by Darren Farr from Sydney. the peanut butter is unusual in that it&amp;#39;s very dark in colour and thick and tastes like sesame seed paste.<br&gt;<br&gt;3) Scrambled eggs here are creamy and buttery and fluffy. A big portion. $6<br&gt;<br&gt;4) I&amp;#39;ve had the ricotta (also housemade) a few times just with toast. $6<br&gt;<br&gt;5) Smoked salmon. Again this is done inhouse and hot smoked and a highlight.<br&gt;<br&gt;6) Coffee is from Common Man Roasters - 22 Martin Rd blend is the house blend but I always ask for the single origin as I do not like the 22 Martin one whether made at Common Man Roasters or here. No extra charge. $5<br&gt;<br&gt;Other things I like - There is free wifi. The place is quiet in the mornings on weekdays with ample parking right outside. I&amp;#39;ve been several times and seen Chef Farr there many times so it&amp;#39;s nice to have a place where the original chef owner is actually on the floor and in the kitchen regularly. In fact, this morning he sent over some of their (housemade of course) kaya and we all really liked it! More subtly flavoured with a light caramel taste.<br&gt;<br&gt;What&amp;#39;s missing for the last star. The place looks nice but the atmosphere of it isn&amp;#39;t quite that relaxed Aussie feel. The coffee if from the single origin tastes not bad but isn&amp;#39;t as good as Common Man Roaster&amp;#39;s rendition. I think it could be a little fresher. It&amp;#39;s kinda slow to come. Service can be up and down but I decided to review because recently I find that service has improved. They have some new staff that seem quite enthusiastic which is nice. They seem to take a bit long to get the bill ready even though it&amp;#39;s not that crowded on weekday mornings and some of us need to get to our real jobs!"

But to be honest, calling Lokal a cafe really doesn&amp;#39;t do the justice as its food standard is one of the highest in SG. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unlike the weekday mornings, the place was PACKED. They had a waiting list of people to be seated around 11:30am. But I was able to grab a seat at the chef&amp;#39;s counter and gawk at all the delicious foods that were coming freshly out of the kitchen and enjoy my food. <br&gt;<br&gt;I started off with English breakfast tea-- not bad, but nothing exceptional. But I wish there was an option to have the tea set out of the pot as the tea got way too bitter towards the end of my meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;Then I had the roasted pumpkin salad  (5/5 )which just AMAZED me. One of the best salad I&amp;#39;ve had. It&amp;#39;s flavorful without being drenched in dressing and just the right heartiness with well-cooked, yet still firm pupkin, healthy mix of quinoa and nuts, and fresh beans. It is definitely a must try.<br&gt;<br&gt;Then finished the meal with the chef&amp;#39;s first attempt at anzac cookies (4/5; Australian traditional cookies--made with coconut and oats) and my gosh. I&amp;#39;m generally not a huge fan of oat cookies, but this sweetness was just right. And for that I had to order a cup of long black (I&amp;#39;ve come to not call it Americano anymore while in Singapore) to go along. I was told the beans were roasted by Sarnies and the blend was created in-house, and was called fuzzy wuzzy (4.5/5). But boy did they do a good job. The aroma and the finishing note of the coffee well-complemented the cookie. <br&gt;<br&gt;Really aiming to come for dinner in the upcoming weeks."

The three of us stood outside Gothe Institut scratching our heads, where&amp;#39;s The Lokal?<br&gt;<br&gt;A quick phone call and one of the service staff came out to &amp;#34;pick us&amp;#34;. Somehow the diagonal entrance escaped our eyes. <br&gt;<br&gt;Walking into the cafe, it was fairly empty. At around 7pm, there were only 2 tables filled. The full fledged bar welcomes us as we entered then the open kitchen at the back. As we had made reservations, we were seated where the nice cushion seats were. Tucked in a cosy corner, it was the perfect place for 3 girls to hangout and share our hearts out.<br&gt;<br&gt;The menu came and we were told that the mains &amp;amp; appetizers are changed regularly. Since we decided on a side of truffle chips, we gave the appetizers a miss and ordered our mains. Recommendations from the service staff were the pork belly with Apple sauce and lamb shank in crispy wrap with cous cous. We ordered 2 pork belly and a lamb. To conclude our meal, we had the Sticky date pudding.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Truffle chips were served first, pipping hot with a huge serving of shredded cheese on top. The fragrance of the truffle oil was immense, totally tickled our nostrils.<br&gt;<br&gt;The pork belly was tender and literally melts in your mouth. The sweetness of the apple sauce nicely complemented the pork belly, lifting the palette from pleasure to joy. The portion was a little too much for me but a regular dude would have consumed it completely in glee. I didn&amp;#39;t get to taste the lamb but I to say that it&amp;#39;s not for the faint-hearted. The lamb is pungent (not in a bad way) so non-lamb lovers, beware. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now comes the sticky date pudding, the divine one that we all three swore we will be back when we need a pick-me-up. Rich and thick dark caramel sauce, coupled with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and a really warm pudding, our tongue was dancing between the sensation of hot and cold and the sweetness from the sauce was balanced nicely with the ice cream. The pudding was moist and lovely.<br&gt;<br&gt;Dinner ended on a high note as we leave and were sent off with &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34;s from the staff. <br&gt;<br&gt;So coming back for the sticky date pudding!"

As we were there for the first time, I wasn&amp;#39;t really sure on where to order and asked one of the staffs about it. She directed us to the front where you can see the computer.<br&gt;<br&gt;Before making payments, what looked good to me was the Lemongrass Galangal Seafood Risotto. And of course, Milo Godzilla pudding for the dessert. My friends ordered the brunch platter for 2/3 pax and grilled barramundi fillet with holy basil almond pesto.<br&gt;<br&gt;Food came pretty earlier than what I expected. Mine came first and I started digging in without much hesitation. Was into risotto lately (hmmm).. My food has a strong aroma (which made me even hungrier than before) and the first bite, you can taste the different flavors bursting on your tongue. I love the touch of the ingredients especially the lemongrass condiments and the chilli inside the risotto. Overall, two thumbs up. The downside was that it was on the higher end and the portion wasn&amp;#39;t big. <br&gt;<br&gt;Tried the brunch platter - it consist quite a variety (seen on the picture). I always crave for good fries and the fries have a crispy touch on it. I tried hashbrowns and the lemon dill fish fingers has fresh peach on it. The Crispy Chicken Tortilla was also good. All of them has perfect touch of condiments/sauces in them which made the taste last inside the mouth. The grilled barramundi filet wasn&amp;#39;t that wow. <br&gt;<br&gt;For the Milo Godzilla pudding, I was searching for &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; desserts and this one caught my eye straightaway even before my friend announced that she would like to order one portion too. Like a molten lava cake, it has ice cream on top (coconut flavored if I wasn&amp;#39;t wrong) and chocolate cake at the bottom. The chocolate cake was moist. I am glad that we ordered just one dessert as we couldn&amp;#39;t probably finish if we have more.<br&gt;<br&gt;Interior design wasn&amp;#39;t too fancy. Open concept kitchen and open concept layout with some modern touches on its furnitures. Price like I mentioned, it is on the higher end but since it is located at one of the touristy places - Botanical Gardens, price range for me was al-right. Will be back for more in the future :)"

If you&amp;#39;re getting the all-day brunch, I&amp;#39;d highly recommend the mushrooms.<br&gt;<br&gt;My drink however, was sub-par and disappointing, and with the $4.50 price tag, it was something I could have done at home - dunk a tea bag in hot tea and heavily dilute it with milk, then pour it on ice. I&amp;#39;d definitely come back, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t get the Iced Tea. That&amp;#39;s a no-no."

The atmosphere is quite nice as well, really green and casual with concrete floors, wooden tables and an open kitchen. On a Sunday afternoon expect to see many families with kids there, which makes for a loud, messy environment. I don&amp;#39;t mind kids, I think they&amp;#39;re really entertaining to watch, but I know some other reviewers complained that there were too many kids....<br&gt;<br&gt;The food was also very good! I&amp;#39;ve been getting a bit tired of hawker food, so I was willing to spend a little bit more to get a little taste of home. I ordered the grilled ham and cheese and roasted tomato salad, total was $13. The sandwich was served on ciabatta bread with greens and Dijon mustard vinigrette with sliced roasted ham and ooey goeey melty cheese (havarti, I think). I&amp;#39;m not sure if the sandwich was actually really good, or if I just missed bread and cheese so much that it didn&amp;#39;t matter how good it was. I do think the sandwich could use more cheese- If I knew how little they would put I would have asked for extra, and been willing to pay for it. The roasted tomato salad was good, but not amazing. I was expecting grilled tomatoes on a plate seasoned with lemon and salt and pepper, but the dish was more like half of a sliced mushy tomato on a  bed of greens. It was okay, but I think the dish could use a better dressing and more tomatoes. Being the seasoned eater that I am I can frequently think of ways to make a dish better, but don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, the food here is good.<br&gt;<br&gt;I think the cheapest item on the lunch menu is the chicken rendang S$ 9 and on the breakfast menu (served from 8:30-10:30?) is the mee rebus for S$ 5.<br&gt;<br&gt;One complaint I have is the people from the milkshake stand out front asked my friend and I three times if we wanted to buy a milkshake. The stand (some university partnership with FFT) is raising funds for children in Cambodia, which is a good cause and all, but I would have appreciated not being asked to buy a milkshake three times in a ten minute interval.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in the area definitely see the Botanic Gardens. Food For Thought makes a great reward for your long, sweaty walk though the gardens. :D"

Serves the typical array of American breakfast foods, from eggs &amp;amp; hash browns to pancakes, some with an extra flare. Two people in my group had the chocolate and raspberry pancakes, which were delicious! I also loved the hash browns I ordered (which were like American tater tots). The other food were tasty too. We came here for brunch so we didn&amp;#39;t try a lot of the lunch menu items. The one I did try-- the ratatouille -- was mediocre. The ambiance was casual.<br&gt;<br&gt;They get docked some stars because of the ordering system which is a little confusing. You have to order and pay at the counter, and give them your table number so they can deliver it to the right table when the food comes. We had to make sure someone was sitting at the table so that it wasn&amp;#39;t taken. It was also pretty crowded and busy so the service wasn&amp;#39;t the fastest (although it&amp;#39;s mostly self-service so you have to be pretty proactive about asking the wait staff for what you need).

Afterall, I was fond of its concept- a cause to support, breakfast components dissected to variable portions and trendy marketing: whats there not to love?<br&gt;<br&gt;Sad to say, I was disappointed both times when I went to visit. While the interior of the place is gorgeous (plants growing out of tables, mind you)- I found the ordering system counter-intuitive and user-unfriendly. The restaurant expects you to first find yourself a table, (have someone to) chope the seat, and queue at the ordering counter. When ordering, you are supposed to tell them exactly where you are seated (basically screwed if someone else takes your seat) or they will refuse to let you order until you have found an alternative seat. I can imagine what a hard time this would give single diners, or worse, having to split up lovey-eyed couples by forcing one to queue thereby subjecting them to a painful 20 minutes wait before they reunite! The &amp;#39;choping&amp;#39; mechanism also makes me feel very ugly- I once had to tell someone with a crying baby on hand that basically all the seats around me were reserved. It is also very Singaporean, which surprises me, because Botanics is afterall a touristy place which attracts people whose culture might be vastly different from ours. I imagine this system to be completely indiscernible to them (I have seen foreigners bitch at staff over it).<br&gt;<br&gt;Even the food is not comparable to the other outlet. My scrambled eggs came too buttery, it was like drinking oil, but I didn&amp;#39;t even feel like sending it back because it would possibly mean having to wait for another half an hour. The menu is also different from the other outlet&amp;#39;s- so if you are thinking of heading to this one for a specific dish, remember to check the online menu before you make your trip down."

It seems the hype is well and truly over as I found myself able to walk straight in and place my order (a selection of the entire range currently being 15 in total and one more to make up a circular box of 16 for 58 Singapore Dollars) Although this may have been due more to the fact that I waltzed in around 2:15 in the evening when most potential customers are busy at work.<br&gt;<br&gt;Having tried the entire range on offer at the time we came to our judgements. Our favorites went in this order (best to worst) Chocolate Cafe (seasonal), Chocolate, Vanilla,  Salted Caramel, Lemon, Pistachio and Green Apple (seasonal).<br&gt;<br&gt;I have to agree with other people on the salted caramel also - whilst we could definitely taste the caramel there wasn&amp;#39;t so much of a hint of the salt. <br&gt;<br&gt;Although these macarons were pleasant are they worth the price? At 3.80 Singapore Dollars a macarons bar the golden coated one, it does come in below prices elsewhere so by that reasoning I suppose its not bad value for a world renowned brand.<br&gt;<br&gt;Worth a look in if your in Singapore and the surroundings are quite pleasant too."

I find that no other bakery or place makes macarons quite as deliciously as they do there, and there are no locations nearby me in Los Angeles. So on my latest visit to Singapore, I was so glad to have found out about this location.<br&gt;<br&gt;They are set up as a macarons only boutique inside the Takashimaya shopping center, and they have a variety of macarons and teas for sale. There were some new flavors here that I was excited to try that they didn&amp;#39;t have back in the Paris location when I visited last December, such as the Marie Antoinette tea and the Green Apple. I found the Green Apple flavor to be particularly delicious, and had I known this when I was making my purchase I would have definitely bought more.<br&gt;<br&gt;The macarons are sold in a variety of different sizes. We opted to buy a box of 8 in a &amp;#34;Singapour&amp;#34; Ladurée box for $40 (SGD) and a round container of 15 for $60 (SGD). Prices are quite steep, especially for just a dessert item, but they were delicious and just like the ones that you can find in Paris. It&amp;#39;s a very distinct taste that is only perfected by Ladurée, and taking a bite of the macaron sent me back to Paris! When doing the currency conversion, the price is only slightly higher (by a couple cents) of the cost of a macaron in Paris (one macaron is about 2.5 euros). We also found out that their macarons are flown in and made all the way in Switzerland!<br&gt;<br&gt;So overall, definitely a steep price to pay, but in my opinion it was quite worth it! I would definitely love to return here if I ever visit Singapore again, and if you are from the area, I would absolutely recommend that you come try some!"

Chocolate yuzu was an interesting mix of citrus tang and fragrance, and melded well with the chocolate ganache. Having a barbie moment, I picked out the strawberry marshmallow as well, drawn by its saccharine hue. Now macaron fillings are typically jam, cream or ganache and this was an unexpected twist, with the pull of marshmallow providing a slight chew. Somebody&amp;#39;s even more a mad scientist than I am, apparently. And I can&amp;#39;t really recall what was the third one I had, only that it was blue.<br&gt;<br&gt;I got six but gave half away as in general I&amp;#39;m not much of a macaron fan - I find the gritty texture rather unappealing.

They are inefficient but friendly. <br&gt;<br&gt;I only hope for the service staffs to improve or the reputation for this place might just be a take out macaroon place and for the macaroon snobs. <br&gt;<br&gt;Good for a touch and go stop or treat to yourself but nothing more."

Although, the ones at PAUL bakery (same holding company as Laduree) and Antoinette are quite good. <br&gt;<br&gt;Anyways, when I heard Laduree was coming to SG, I was so excited! I didn&amp;#39;t go the first week when it just opened (the news reported that lines were crazy), but there was still a bit of a line when I got there this weekend...not too long...maybe 7 minutes. <br&gt;<br&gt;The price was pretty on par with what I paid in NY. After buying a box of 8, I took a bite out of my orange blossom and it was slightly disappointing  -- for some reason, it didn&amp;#39;t have that light, airy fresh feeling as the orange blossom I had in NY.   Maybe they weren&amp;#39;t as fresh as the ones that they shipped to NY because of distance...but it was still very good quality though.

In my opinion, the best bubble tea in Singapore (and LA, not that that&amp;#39;s saying much). <br&gt;<br&gt;There&amp;#39;s something about Koi that makes it taste so good, maybe it&amp;#39;s the type of milk they use, maybe it&amp;#39;s the pearls - maybe it&amp;#39;s both. <br&gt;<br&gt;The milk just tastes different - slightly creamier and fuller in taste, perhaps? Yet, it gives just the right amount of creamy-ness without being overpowering, letting the flavor of the tea balance the milk out. This gives your Bubble Tea the perfect consistency, every single time. <br&gt;<br&gt;The pearls are made the perfect texture, probably the best I&amp;#39;ve tasted (chewy &amp;amp; bouncy but not too hard) and slightlyyy smaller than your average pearl size making it super fun it sip / chew on. The slightly smaller pearl size also gives you the perfect pearl/tea ratio when you sip it up, if that even makes sense. <br&gt;<br&gt;My favorites? The regular Milk Tea, Hazelnut Milk Tea or Honey Milk Tea - with pearls! Oh and, if you&amp;#39;re into grass jelly, you must ask for both grass jelly AND pearls! I love that they give you freshly made huge chunks of grass jelly here instead of shredded up pieces like at most bubble tea places. <br&gt;<br&gt;There can be a little bit of a wait for Koi, but no where near when the Bubble Tea craze was at its peak. Still, their standards have remained high and I&amp;#39;d pick Koi over Gong Cha or Each-a-Cup any day."

Decided to get myself an Asian Chicken Salad and Cheese Soup, whilst my friend got their Sausage Baked Penne Pasta, coupled with imported bottled juice drinks from the chilled section. <br&gt;The salad was pre-packaged in a plastic container. It had lettuce, baby corn, chicken breast, and broccoli. The sesame dressing that came with was much too little for me and the salad itself was below average, the meat was tough and dry. <br&gt;The hot food however, addressed our hunger pangs. The soup, which came with two pieces of herb bread was flavourful and creamy with chunks of potato in it. The pasta was covered with melted cheese and spicy chorizo sausage. Both dishes were of nice serving portions. <br&gt;I gave them a four star because of its location, 24/7 opening hours, and for a mega coffee chain, they did have some decent food to offer to customers besides the usual sandwiches and muffins. They were also quick in serving us as we had to catch the last train back."

Personally, I prefer Brill as it reminds me of laneway cafes that you get over in Melbourne, Australia. The small spaces and privacy are one of a kind!

For lunch, they serve gourmet sandwiches as well with coffee/tea. Desserts are also available in their fridge.<br&gt;<br&gt;First visit and I had an Aussie 90 days grainfed ribeye stinky $4/100g!!!

Kaya toast is kaya spread &amp;amp; butter sandwiched in two thin slices of toasted white bread. Kaya is a green  or brown paste ( the color depends if yours had panada leaves in it) made out of thicken coconut milk and sugar, reduced into a paste.

Décor is minimal, with lines kept very clean and the space kept very neat.<br&gt;<br&gt;What I really appreciate is the way the food items are being displayed- each bread is showcased behind a clear panel and labeled with flags. I am mostly a creature of habit (meaning I keep going back for the same stuff all the time), but the labeled items do sometimes catch my attention and I find myself more willing to try them especially if they have an interesting name or contain an interesting ingredient.<br&gt;<br&gt;While the menu is not extensive (mostly sandwiches and some breakfast items), I can safely say all of the items are worth a try. My favourite has to be the Tuna Croissant (~$6 I think)- they have the fluffiest buttery croissant, freshest lettuce and the tuna filling is so melt-in-your-mouth good. On days when I get crazy carbohydrate cravings, I find myself gravitating to the Peanut Butter and Banana sandwich- so rich and so comforting.

I&amp;#39;ve tried all the sugar cane stalls there are at Tiong Bahru Market, and 238 still remains unsurpassed. Icy, sweet, tangy, and importantly, sugar cane fibre free. The server inside will first pick out a fat wedge of lemon and squeeze the juice into a plastic cup filled with ice before plonking the squashed lemon body inside. The cup is then filled to the brim with sugar cane and handed over to you, while you dish up your measly $1.40.

Enjoyed my visit on both visits, staying an average of about 2 hours. I&amp;#39;m giving it a 3 Yelp stars based on the following factors:<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Ambience: 4/5. Very comfy seating with multiple configurations to choose from - conventional height round and rectangle tables with chairs and 3 sets of sofa seats. <br&gt;<br&gt;Most impressed with the living room setting at the back of the cafe: long faux leather sofa with TV, side table and bookcase. Talk about making you feel right at home? They&amp;#39;ve done that well.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ended up sitting in the same sofa seat on both visits because that&amp;#39;s the one with the window view - cos I love to people watch.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Service: 4/5. The front counter staff was really friendly and most helpful with suggestions when I couldn&amp;#39;t decide where to sit during my first visit (I prefer seats that are comfortable, not too cold/hot and ideally with a view). <br&gt;<br&gt;We also had a nice convo during my 1st visit and she was very eager to give me info regarding the concept of the cafe (integrated cafe-retail-interior architecture). She remembered me when I visited again which was definitely very nice. <br&gt;<br&gt;3. Food &amp;amp; drinks: 2/5. Unfortunately, the quality of their coffee is really sub-par. I had rose latte and savoury waffles during my first visit - rose latte did not taste good and the waffles was just average.<br&gt;<br&gt;The long black that my friend and I had on my 2nd visit was still ok, but the red velvet cake that we had was really bad. I&amp;#39;ve not had such bad red velvet cakes in a while. <br&gt;<br&gt;4. Cool integrated concept: 4/5. Interestingly, the cafe is integrated with their interior architecture office, so, customers get to see the staff working at their tables at the back of the cafe, and the staff get to see some of the customers too. <br&gt;<br&gt;Though, I&amp;#39;m not too sure whether this integrated space is really good for productivity? Won&amp;#39;t the staff be disturbed by noisy customers? I&amp;#39;m not sure, maybe I&amp;#39;ll ask the friendly front counter staff next time.<br&gt;<br&gt;I hope they do something to improve their food and drinks quality. It&amp;#39;s a shame as they did up the interior very well and it&amp;#39;s really cosy, so, they really should do justice to the place."

Rating is based on espresso. It&amp;#39;s Starbucks bad and I swear I&amp;#39;m tasting a mold aftertaste. Too bad as the cookie with it is very nice. <br&gt;Come for the free wifi(8.55mbps) and ambience. Stay clear of the coffees or maybe just the flavored coffees. Someone told me the iced hazelnut is good.

Since u work from home. I really like spending time there . The coffee selection is amazing! My favorite at the moment are really their ice blends. The staff is always really friendly and it&amp;#39;s a great place to get some work done.

Epicurious is friendly and nice, fairly welcoming. We were there during a soft-opening weekend, which meant they were still waiting for some electrical work to be finished and, thus, some items on the menu couldn&amp;#39;t be made. Still, breakfasts looked quite attractive.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had the eggs benedict while my wife had scrambled eggs on green pesto. Both were good and did the job, but were a bit lackluster. We ended up with an uneasy feeling, that there was something missing. I mean, food tastes good, but is far away from spectacular, and that&amp;#39;s when Epicurious starts losing points. There&amp;#39;s no &amp;#34;wow! factor&amp;#34;, nothing that would make us be anxious to go back. The bill just confirmed this uneasy feeling. We realised that for the same amount we could walk a few blocks and have a dazzling breakfast, or a much more memorable breakfast in Tiong Bahru. Even on UE Square itself, we can get a much more thrilling breakfast for less.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our friends at Epicurious do a good job and are clearly making an effort. Unfortunately, the food ends up being average while prices are not. I wish they can overcome this gap, they surely deserve better."
