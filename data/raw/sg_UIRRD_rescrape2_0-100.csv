Then, when I tried the coffee -- it was very much to my liking. <br&gt;<br&gt;Next thing you know is that I ordered an iced coffee to-go after we finished our breakfast. In the future, I&amp;#39;m going to have to take some of that Singaporean coffee with me back to the states for us and our friends.<br&gt;<br&gt;Back to the kaya toast -- it&amp;#39;s regular white bread toast that is loaded with guilt, but it tastes so good.

Yum!<br&gt;<br&gt;This place is where locals grab a quick bite to eat before they move on with their day. It&amp;#39;s seat yourself but could also end up sharing tables.

With so many Starbucks around, I soon associated this Starbucks as the one who was flooded during the great big flood (or &amp;#34;ponding&amp;#34; which one Singapore Minister described it as) in Orchard Road a few years ago. The outdoor chairs and tables were floating around and luckily everybody got out of harm&amp;#39;s way. Since then barriers have been installed and will be raised if there is a heavy downpour. So customers can sip away with no fear. I guess renovation also took place and the place now has many types of seating available. <br&gt;<br&gt;It has been some time since I last stepped foot into this Starbucks. The layout is still the same. The coffee (caramel macchiato) is still good. There is something to be said about drinking coffee from a proper mug and not from a paper cup. It somehow tastes better. <br&gt;<br&gt;There are outdoor seating which is great to people watch or to enjoy warm breeze. Shades are available outdoor too. You can also people watch indoor as there is a long bar counter by the window. Also a good option if you want to be alone and do some work or read. <br&gt;<br&gt;There is a sofa set with stools for bigger group and a table with two cushioned chairs. They are comfortable but they are also right underneath the spotlights. So you may feel the heat after a while. <br&gt;<br&gt;Against one wall is a row of cushioned long bench. It looks very comfortable until you realize there is no proper back rest and the table is too low. I am short but I did not realize how short until I found out my feet did not touch the floor when I sat there. I am beginning to feel like Goldilocks trying to find a reasonably comfortable chair. This is also when I really noticed the different types of chairs and seating available in this outlet. <br&gt;<br&gt;In the middle are round cocktail style tables with high chairs for two and a long table with cold metal chairs to encourage communal sharing or very big groups.<br&gt;<br&gt;So there you have it. You can either have comfortable chairs but be heated up or try to get comfortable in metal chairs or high chairs or very low back cushioned seats."

The colour scheme is warm &amp;amp; inviting and the music is soothing. Service is as slow as any other Starbucks in Singapore (sorry guys I used to live in Hong Kong) and the coffee is just as terrible... but they have plenty of syrupy frappucinos.<br&gt;<br&gt;But honestly if you mark down Starbucks on the basis of coffee quality then you&amp;#39;re probably the sort of person who expects flowers from SingTel when your phone reception drops out. Get a grip on reality, people!<br&gt;<br&gt;But I digress. This place is open 24 hours, which is awesome.

It shares the second storey with a LAN gaming cafe together with several pool tables. It looks like a very chill out spot for late nights with the boys. But on a saturday afternoon at 2pm, it was rather quiet, and only the cafe was open for business.<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Soya Soba Salad $7<br&gt;Tobiko Roe, poached egg, black and white sesame, purple cabbage, sweet pea and secret dressing. This sounded quite a lot for just $7. I really loved the poached egg except for the fact that someone else stole the honour of bursting the egg yolk from me. The tobiko roe was a great salad topper. The soba noodles were soft and had a slight taste. The dressing was rather diluted and the overall taste of the salad was bland but definitely a healthy food option.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Cheese Munchies $6<br&gt;The staff promoted this appetizer to us as fried potato balls with cheese on the inside. She did warn us that there would be like 7 pieces for the price of $6. But we went ahead and ordered it. The outside was very crispy and it wasn&amp;#39;t very solid, some parts of the munchie you could see right through it. You could definitely see the cheese on the inside, without having to split the muchie.<br&gt;They were served hot and do let it cool down before taking a bite. They were pretty interesting but definitely not worth the money.<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Cheesey Beef Fries $7I was sort of craving cheese fries or truffle fries due to the fact that while looking through the menu, you could smell the truffle aroma from the kitchen from another order. The serving was pretty decent for the price, but the fries weren&amp;#39;t crisp, they were more on the softer side which ended up being soggy within minutes of settling down on our table. The cheese wasn&amp;#39;t flavourful enough but you could taste the seasoned beef in the mixture.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ground beef, homemade tomato herbed sauce and mozzarella.<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Chicken and Waffles $9.50 *high recommended*Served with maple syrup, but unlike most establishments, there&amp;#39;s no &amp;#34;pouring&amp;#34; of the maple syrup. Rather, the chef drizzled maple syrup onto the chicken and waffle. The waffle itself was crisp and light. It tasted sweet, as if the batter itself was maple infused.<br&gt;<br&gt;The chicken was the highlight on this plate. I could tell that they probably made this in house. The chicken tasted reasonably fresh with a nice black pepper crust. It wasn&amp;#39;t spicy, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong when I say black pepper. But the batter for the chicken was definitely more than just bread crumbs, maybe a secret mixture? The kitchen did a good job executing the chicken with crispness with a golden brown exterior.<br&gt;<br&gt;It was very crispy and the chicken dark meat on the inside was juicy and succulent. Probably one of the better chicken and waffles I&amp;#39;ve tried in Singapore!<br&gt;<br&gt;5. Pulled Pork Sandwich $12I loved the presentation of this dish. The toasted stacked on top of each other with the cheese just drooping down ontop of the other toast. The toasted bread was thick and fluffy, it wasn&amp;#39;t dense at all, so you couldn&amp;#39;t definitely finish this up as a main course. The pulled pork was tender but a bit on the drier side. The pulled pork coupled with that layer of cheese, I was SOLD! I really really loved the creamy and cheesey goodness along with the thick toast. The cheese added substantial flavour to the pulled pork without turning the bread soffy and limp.<br&gt;<br&gt;6. House Special Pizza $17<br&gt;Ground beef, roast chicken, ham, wild mushroom, olive, bell pepper, pineapple and mozzarella.<br&gt;<br&gt;The thin crusted pizza was crispy and had biscuit-like edges which I loved. But on the areas where the ingredients were, the pizza base was doughy and inconsistent. I strongly recommend to consume it with your bare hands as all the ingredients tend to fall off the pizza very easily as you use your utensils to pick it off the plate. It was slightly difficult to slice it off the plate even with the use of cutlery. The combination of the ingredients weorked well and it was a great savoury experience.<br&gt;<br&gt;Forget the calories, just indulge as one slice is never enough! This portion was enough for 4-6 pax.<br&gt;<br&gt;7. Queen Royale Salmon $15<br&gt;Served with slow poached egg, cream cheese, on home made focaccia toast, topped wtih homemade hollandaise and side salad.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall :  A great location to chill out on a weekend, with entertainment options. The food had some hits and misses but definitely go for the eggs, chicken and waffles and the pulled pork sandwich!"

As always, I find myself pondering what to eat every time because there are so many choices. Luckily, we found a table so I suggested for the 2 guys to grab their food first whilst I hold the table. Little did I know, I did not have to order any food for myself. As I was in line for some rice, roasted pork and char siu, Sheng Teck came up to me to tell me that he ordered enough food for him and I. <br&gt;<br&gt;Awwww, right?
