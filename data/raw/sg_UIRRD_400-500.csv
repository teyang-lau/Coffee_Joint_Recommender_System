Was also happy with the customized bowl options since I don&amp;#39;t usually do heavy start like toasts, pancakes, and waffles. They have nice protein selections to choose from and everything seemed really fresh. <br&gt;<br&gt;I created a smoked salmon bowl with guacamole and a nice Onsen egg was just about perfect even without any dressing. The smoked salmon provided the savory element complementing the natural sweetness from the avocado. Onsen egg gave it the creaminess to replace the dressing, and Tobiko gave it that extra hit of umami to round everything out. <br&gt;<br&gt;Probably one of the nicest and cleanest breakfast I had over the last 2 weeks or so."

This must be my 4th if not my 5th time back at at The Coconut Club for lunch and I have not written a review for it. Maybe subconsciously I don&amp;#39;t want to share this place with others. :-)<br&gt;<br&gt;Very popular place for lunch in An Siang Hill. The owner is meticulous about his source of coconut and that is clear when you taste the nasi lemak.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Menu is really simple. One main dish of nasi lemak with 2 pcs of chicken (breast or leg aka light or dark), peanuts, fried anchovies, fried egg sunny side up, crunchy cucumber slices and a spoonful of sambal chili.  Besides the main dish, there are lots of sides like otah and sotong(squid). The main dish is big and I hardly have space for the sides. <br&gt;<br&gt;A good plate of nasi lemak must be fragrant with coconut without tasting like you are eating coconut. Nasi lemak at TCC is very good. I love the chicken pieces. So tender and deliciously marinated with ginger and other spices. Every little side items are fine so well. The ikan bilis (fried anchovies) is crispy. The peanuts are just the right size. <br&gt;<br&gt;Only one thing I&amp;#39;m unhappy about. The side of the plate is too shallow. I kept pushing my food out onto the table. Maybe that&amp;#39;s just me. <br&gt;<br&gt;Lots of drinks of local flavors to choose from. Homemade calamansi (lime), homemade barley, bandung (rose syrup with evaporated milk) etc. <br&gt;<br&gt;For dessert try the chendol. It is made with palm sugar and coconut milk. You can have it with it without red beans. Go for the red beans. Today they had a special coconut jelly dessert that is so beautifully done. Looks simple but tasted complex. The jelly is smooth not like agar agar. The coconut meat gave it a nice texture. Small dish big taste (of coconut of course)<br&gt;<br&gt;Definitely a place to visit but be here around 1130-1145. Past that it will fill up and if you have a party of 6, be ready to wait at least 30 minutes."

Aiight, I&amp;#39;ll pay for it.<br&gt;<br&gt;I went on a Friday night and got a seat right away which is a nice change for Club Street that&amp;#39;s always bustling and with people spilling onto the street. Service was fairly prompt, and it would have been nice to have the specials on the board instead of me having to ask if the menu was all there is to it and then the server then filling in the gaps on their specials of the day.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the nasi lemak (of course) and the sayur lemak (which is apparently the less creamy version of sayur lodeh - it certainly tasted that way too) which was one of the specials. The nasi lemak came out looking delicious! The rice was coconut-y and fragrant, the egg was a nice oozy crisp, the ikan bilis was fried without being too hard, the chilli was a little too much on the spicy side (and just not as delicious as the one at Adam Road) and the chicken was glorious. The chicken was a full thigh and drumstick, was marinated in this delicious marinade (lots of local herbs - lemongrass and the like) and fried to juicy perfection. Yum. The sayur lemak had a really good broth - possibly ikan bilis? I made the unfortunate mistake of mixing all the chilli into it and ended up sniffling my way through my meal although it was really quite delicious. Although they also serve alcohol, my dining companion and I both got the lemongrass tea which was serviceable.<br&gt;<br&gt;This was all-in-all a very satisfying meal, and although I might still return to Adam Road for my nasi lemak fix (at a much lower price point too), I wouldn&amp;#39;t say no to anyone asking me to get nasi lemak if I were ever in the Club Street area."

Crown Bakery is located in an old school building, Crown Plaza which is about 8 minutes walk from Botanic Garden. I like the contrast between this modern looking bakery and the rundown building.<br&gt;<br&gt;Interior of the bakery looks modern and just by one look at its facade, you can tell that they are selling artisan breads.<br&gt;<br&gt;Coming here for Brunch, Crown recommends the Crown Breakfast. The price might seem abit step for a brunch but portion is good for 2 pax. Look at the centre of the wooden board! The Crown Puff Pastry was the total scene stealer. They recommend to break the edge of the pastry and dip it into the sunny side up&amp;#39;s egg yolk!  Served along with the centrepiece crown pastry are,  red wine-braised oxtail, chicken cheese sausage, Canadian back bacon, sauteed mushrooms, baked tomato &amp;amp; mesclun salad as its side.<br&gt;<br&gt;Crown Breakfast - $29<br&gt;<br&gt;Since the Crown is for the King, why not try a dish for the queen, the Eggs Benedict. Though the poached egg might be slightly overcooked, I&amp;#39;m still in love with the combination where poached eggs were served with shaved honey baked ham, both sitting on the Crown&amp;#39;s fluffy Sourdough English Muffin, coupled with Hollandaise sauce and mesclun Salad as its side. You can choose to have sourdough muffin or multigrain but the former is definitely recommended.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Queen&amp;#39;s Eggs Ben - $15<br&gt;<br&gt;We had something new from the menu and that would be their Steak Sandwich serving with Mesclun Salad as their side too. Ciabatta was Crown&amp;#39;s handcrafted and toasted. What I like best was its mouth watering sirloin steak grilled to medium well perfection, stacked with layers of lettuce, tomatoes and drizzled with onion marmalade and topped with gherkin. Recommended!<br&gt;<br&gt;Steak Sandwich - $18<br&gt;<br&gt;What a satisfying branch I had! Having visiting Crown Bakery randomly, its definitely worth going back once more for their branch and sandwiches."

The orange peels and walnuts inside the bread enhanced the taste.<br&gt;3) Lemmy Lemonade for beverage<br&gt;4) New Zealand Cream Cheese Danish - the cheese danish was also flaky (more dessert-like flakes) and tasty and the cream cheese on the top was not too sweet - tried a small bite of this.<br&gt;5) Hainanese chicken bread with chili sauce on the side - mild taste and the small bits of chicken and a dip of chili sauce helped to enhance the chicken rice flavor in the bread. <br&gt;<br&gt;This cafe offers both indoor and outdoor seating. Unfortunately the indoor seating is limited so you might need to come at the right time. <br&gt;<br&gt;When you go in, you will see different kinds of breads or pastries on the side. Then you will need to line up before you get to the counter where you order dishes or beverages on the menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unfortunately for us, they got our orders confused or even missed our orders. On my end, they forgot to serve me my drink and had to get the cutleries on my own.

The Taro kaya sauce was delicious, not too sweet yet enough to give your toast the kick it needed. <br&gt;<br&gt;I also tried the Thai green milk tea which is priced at $2.80. Previous yelpers had noted how they witnessed the workers brewing the tea right in front of them, but my experience was a bit different. Perhaps they have tried to operationalize the practice to be more efficient, but all I saw was the workers pouring pre-made Thai milk tea into my cup and sealing it. I think it took away from my perception of authenticity, but regardless, the drink was good. <br&gt;<br&gt;I would perhaps come back here if I happen to be hungry in suntec, but likely would not come back craving it."

I didn&amp;#39;t try them as I was too full but next time, I&amp;#39;ll be sure to try their Truffle Fries ($15).  If you guys try it, let me know how it goes."

That was the BEST dessert to EVER hit my tongue. I can&amp;#39;t believe it. It was hot, moist, just the right density, the sauce was perfectly caramelly with just a little saltiness, and the vanilla bean icecream completed the whole thing. Like, man. That was so good. <br&gt;<br&gt;Two things to know before dining here: if it&amp;#39;s busy, you might wait 40+mins for food, and if you&amp;#39;re sitting outside, bring mosquito repellent. There&amp;#39;s not many bugs out there, but if you&amp;#39;re like me and happen to be a walking Mozzie Buffet, sitting right by the jungle can be an....er, interesting experience. <br&gt;<br&gt;HOWEVER. The food here is great! I absolutely LOVED their Pad Thai Salad - the prawns were tender and well cleaned, the veggies were fresh and crunchy, and the peanut sauce and flavourful spices were delicious. 10/10 would order again. I also loved their ranges of Gin - the subtle tastes and flavours were really fun to explore. <br&gt;<br&gt;Tried the truffle fries and honestly don&amp;#39;t have too much to say. They were pretty average, and the first batch we had to send back to the kitchen because they were stone cold :/ the hot ones were nice enough, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t order them again. <br&gt;<br&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;ve already raved about their Sticky Date, but we also grabbed PS&amp;#39;s specialty brownie...which actually wasn&amp;#39;t that great, to be honest! It looks FASCINATING, stacked a mile high with huge fluffy marshmallows and covered with ganache, but the brownie itself was more the consistency of a sponge, and it was sickeningly sweet. Even the ice cream wasn&amp;#39;t enough of a break between the hectic chocolate gooeyness, so we all ended up going cross-eyed from sugar overload and only eating 1/4 of the slice all up. Considering the calibre of the other meals we ordered, this one was a bit of a disappointment. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service: 4/5 stars<br&gt;Food: 4/5 stars overall<br&gt;Atmosphere: 5/5 stars<br&gt;Speed: 1.5/5 stars on a busy day."

The fries that came with the burger, however, were thickly cut and wonderful! They came with a mayo dip that seemed to be infused with a zesty taste and some herb that I couldn&amp;#39;t quite identify.

Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to visit the cafe. <br&gt;<br&gt;The atmosphere was great, as always, but service was slow.

Both are delicious and I always make room for them. Not a fan of anything a la mode though, so I usually request for the ice-cream on the side, or not at all. Their cakes go great with tea (or coffee, if you are on that side of the camp) and their selection is fair but nothing to gush over.<br&gt;<br&gt;My favorite thing about PS Cafe at Harding Road is its amazing location and how it feels like a greenhouse that&amp;#39;s cool (thank you air-conditioning) and yet is surrounded by greenery everywhere.

Oh, the smell of truffle fries wants me to come back...<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall score: 4.2/5 - will return. Great for tea.<br&gt;<br&gt;---<br&gt;Atmosphere<br&gt;---<br&gt;PS Cafe on 28B Harding Road isn&amp;#39;t easy to find unless you know what you&amp;#39;re looking for, but when you do find it, you&amp;#39;ll realize why. The entrance is to the &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; of the establishment if you&amp;#39;re coming from Dempsey Hill, and is located on Harding Road on the way to the White Rabbit. It&amp;#39;s sunk low into the ground, on a hill.<br&gt;<br&gt;The interior decor is astounding, and it clearly reflects its founders&amp;#39; taste in fashion and design (did you know that PS Cafe stands for Project Shop Cafe, for back when it was a cafe attached to a fashion goods store?) A tall ceiling combined with floor-to-ceiling glass partitions keeps the venue air-conditioned and cool while maintaining the feel that you&amp;#39;re still sitting in a cafe in the middle of a rainforest. While the view looks down the hill at the side of a clump of trees/the forest, it actually adds to the experience as the wood is mirrored in the construction of PS Cafe.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chalkboards subtly hint at menu options in discreet locations, while the volume stays at a level where you&amp;#39;re not afraid to talk above a whisper, but neither are you struggling to hear what your buddies are talking about.<br&gt;<br&gt;Score: 4.5/5<br&gt;<br&gt;---<br&gt;Food/Drinks<br&gt;---<br&gt;My buddy and I split a slice of the Golden Banana Butterscotch Cake. Originally, I thought we were going to order our own slices, but then he pointed out how big they were. They&amp;#39;re quite sizable, and for tea or dessert, one is perfectly fine for two people to share. It wasn&amp;#39;t overly dry nor wet, and the taste of banana was subtle and not overbearing. It was accompanied by ice cream, which complimented it perfectly. For the price you&amp;#39;re paying, it was well worth it.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had a Grapefruit Lychee Caipiroska, which I thought was splendid and refreshing for the hot day that it was. A little too much ice for my liking, but it came with sliced grapefruit and lychees floating inside, a touch of effort which I greatly appreciate in a drink. Flavorful and yummy, took the edge off of the vodka that was used, which was perfect.<br&gt;<br&gt;I will add a caveat that this place has me wanting to come back after seeing my friend&amp;#39;s coffee affogato and smelling the truffle fries from the table next to ours.<br&gt;<br&gt;Score: 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;---<br&gt;Service<br&gt;---<br&gt;Polite and friendly would be how I would describe service. Despite ordering maybe two drinks and one food dish, the servers let us continue to sit for about two hours, even though the first sitting for dinner was already filtering in and being served (I felt woefully underdressed in my shorts at this point in time, lol).<br&gt;<br&gt;Score: 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;---<br&gt;Miscellaneous<br&gt;---<br&gt;Nothing to say here that I haven&amp;#39;t already said.<br&gt;<br&gt;Score: nil/5"

The first time around was for brunch on the weekend. It was packed. We were both cheating our Paleo lifestyle because we weren&amp;#39;t feeling well and were craving comfort food. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had the special, which was crab cakes and poached eggs (I think - it&amp;#39;s been awhile). The food was awesome and so was the long black coffee. They brought us a dish of honey for our coffee that was awesome - thick, gooey, and not overly sweet. Not a big deal to most, but I take my coffee pretty seriously! :) Hubby ordered the shepherd&amp;#39;s pie, which was good, but not what he expected. It&amp;#39;s a bit different than the American version because it has ground beef prepared similar to spaghetti sauce inside of it. The views were gorgeous and we were very pleased.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our second trip was for dinner last night. We sat outside and I started out with the Pimm&amp;#39;s Cooler, which is my favorite drink in all of Singapore thus far. I ordered the burger, hold the cheese and the bun and he got the chicken parm, hold the cheese and croutons. Totally hit the spot, and our server did a great job delivering our order - I know we can be a pain trying to make dishes work for Paleo. <br&gt;<br&gt;This place is definitely our speed and we&amp;#39;ll be back again and again."

While not entirely unfair, I do feel that there&amp;#39;s a consistency that is worthy of appreciation.<br&gt;<br&gt;Of all the branches, this is my favourite for a casual night out. Nestled amidst lush greenery, when you sit outdoors it&amp;#39;s almost possible to forget you&amp;#39;re still in Singapore. Almost no roads in sight, just vegetation, it&amp;#39;s a nice place to spend the evening, or even an afternoon. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food and drink are, to me, are more than satisfactory. I love their house salad, a mixed green salad livened up by blueberries, sunflower seeds, and a delicious pomegranate dressing. Very addictive. I also thoroughly enjoy their mud crab pasta. While I usually don&amp;#39;t order crab because I&amp;#39;m lazy to work for my food, the flavour of the crab blends very well with the sauce, and I order it almost every time I go. <br&gt;<br&gt;They have a great mushroom soup, though I forget exactly what they call it, and an excellent selection of cocktails. Their truffle fries are also a big hit, though the lactose intolerant should be aware that theirs come served with cheese. <br&gt;<br&gt;When I first heard of PS.Cafe though, it was for their cakes and desserts. The Chocolate Blackout is IMMENSE, and I refuse to believe anyone can finish it alone. Their puddings are really good, though I found their key lime pie just &amp;#39;okay&amp;#39;. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall it&amp;#39;s a little pricey to be a regular fixture on my weekly schedule, but a great place to head to when you want to meet up with friends you haven&amp;#39;t seen in forever. It can be a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights though, so if you&amp;#39;re hoping for long intense conversations... it&amp;#39;s not always ideal."

They were infused with both flowers and fruit...heaven<br&gt;<br&gt;I normally order the pancakes which are pretty good.  The menu can be a bit pricey but so is everything else in Singapore :)

Honestly, I would not think the drink would blow my socks off but it definitely would score on the aesthetic side. When I was in line, i saw the &amp;#34;Morning Dawn&amp;#34; on their tv screen which has a lighter hue. I thought it looked really pretty. Just when I was the next one to order, I changed my mind and ordered the &amp;#34;Northern Lights&amp;#34; just because it was the 4th most popular drink at The Alley.<br&gt;<br&gt;NORTHERN LIGHTS - Overall: 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;Aesthetic point 5/5 <br&gt;It was so pretty!! <br&gt;<br&gt;Taste 3/5 <br&gt;It tasted somewhat like soda, I was not sure what it really tasted like but it was pretty sweet. I had to stir many times and at the end the drink has not much taste to it. I did stir many times so maybe I needed to stir more??<br&gt;<br&gt;One of us tried the Matcha Brown Sugar Deerioca Milk and mentioned that was so good compared to the Brown Sugar Deerioca Milk we had a week ago. <br&gt;<br&gt;SERVICE 5/5<br&gt;Staff was nice. Told me the Northern Lights would take 10 mins to make. She also asked if I was a member and invited me to sign up using the QR code displayed at the order counter.<br&gt;<br&gt;AMBIENCE 4/5<br&gt;Finally saw a few empty tables. It was around lunch hour on a week day. My complaint?? This store needs a lesson in cleaning. Staffs need to clean those tables periodically. Humans can be nasty, so we can&amp;#39;t trust them to keep the tables clean after they left the premise. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, better overall experience with the drinks and ambience today."

I really like egg tarts so my original assumption was they would be close to that. The crust is thick and reminds me of a shortbread cookie with a bit more moisture. The filling is a sweet tofu but not overbearing. It&amp;#39;s a lovely dessert for people who don&amp;#39;t want too sweet! They held up well in the fridge for 3 days while we snacked on them."

So to prevent this food tragedy, I ringed up the shop like an obedient (or kiasu?) person to reserve my box of mixed Beancurd tarts.<br&gt;<br&gt;Fast forward, I did not imagine the shop to look so modern, unlike the old-school pastries that they sell. It is not like a bakery shop where you take a tong and think what you want to have for breakfast the next day.  Most items are kept in the chiller behind the cashier table. However, there is a display cupboard showing the available items so if you want a box of assorted slice cakes, you have to ask the lady.<br&gt;<br&gt;I grabbed one of the pre-packed goodie ($3.50) whose appearance and name perked my curiosity. &amp;#34;A Classic Treat from the 1960s&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;This colorful retro-looking scones eh no....rock buns are sweetened naturally with the assorted dried fruits. Rest assure that these rocks won&amp;#39;t break your teeth as you pluck of morsels and toss them unstoppable into your mouth. The pineapple golf balls looked as if they lack a bright golden egg wash. But I finally understand why they need to be pre-ordered in advance during CNY. If you only eat the biscuit part like me, they are perfect--Crumbly, not too milky or sickly sweet or sticky. However, the pineapple filling are simply too much( covering about 80% of each tart). <br&gt;<br&gt;And tada....the legendary Beancurd tart. Without the eggy custard smell, they are still wobbly and better than having just tau hway. These are delightfully crumbly and butter, like those from Chin Mee Chin. Shaped like a deep-dish ramekin, one is enough to fill an average stomach after dinner. I feel sorry for egg tarts now because beancurd tarts beat them hands-down. ($9 for a box of 8) <br&gt;<br&gt;Though assorted flavours sound exciting, they really aren&amp;#39;t because they taste the same, for instance peanuts is just a few steamed peanuts tossed into the filling. Not peanut butter.

Each bottle is about $20~ - these are expensive pineapple tarts at $1 per piece but worth every cent.<br&gt;<br&gt;On top of the pineapple tart golf balls, the missus and I are also enamored with chicken floss seaweed twist and will always pick up a bottle along with our golf balls.

This dish was made a little wetter with carrots shredded on top. It&amp;#39;s a more &amp;#34;vegetably&amp;#34; dish compared to the ones found in Geylang Serai. So if you like your dish less &amp;#34;nut&amp;#34; heavy, then this is the place for you. <br&gt;<br&gt;Nasi Lamak- you don&amp;#39;t come to Singapore and not try this dish as the standard Malaysian dish to try. It&amp;#39;s a rice with sides dish that usually comes with fried things. This one in MacRitchie had fried fish cake, a sunny side up, fried chicken wings, and then anchovies with peanuts. It&amp;#39;s a very dried and flavorful dish if you don&amp;#39;t mind something proteinacious and calorically dense- this is not a green colorful dish. The dish here is pretty good- not my style but glad we ordered this signature Malaysian dish! <br&gt;<br&gt;Curry Chicken- I love a good Singaporean curry- it&amp;#39;s a little tumericky and more powdery than the creamier soupier versions you see in the US. It tastes more herbal- stew some potatoes in it for a few hours and it&amp;#39;s the most delicious combination you can have. Curry chicken here was spot on and came with some rice. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall- it&amp;#39;s not your biggest variety that a food circus would have, but it has the representatives of what Singapore is known for. It&amp;#39;s more of a snack stall, so you won&amp;#39;t find more authentic dishes that require large fires and woks. You&amp;#39;ll find rice dishes and things that can be put out for a long time that do not require freshly made food for it to taste good. <br&gt;<br&gt;Drinks were between 120-400 SGD depending on what you&amp;#39;re getting. If you&amp;#39;re hiking here, I recommend the 100 drink which is your gatorade electrolyte replenishment out here."

Excited by the ambiance, I approached the counter to order my coffee. The woman working was exceptionally rude throughout our entire interaction.

Was around this area and I remembered Erik and Marcus saying that the Chendol Smoothie was good during the 1st Elite event in Oct 2014.<br&gt;<br&gt;This time round I also looked more details into the interior designs and the small goodies on the glass cabinet where you can purchase. It was pretty neatly design. As I am more visual person, I tend to go for bold and light colors (yellow, green, blue, orange) and I realized that this place had a combination of the colors I love.<br&gt;<br&gt;Besides that, saw familiar faces at the cashier. I doubt they recognized me as I was with a group of Yelpers when I first visited two months ago. Before stepping into this cafe, I forgotten which smoothie I wanted to try and finally decided on Chendol Smoothie. Since I wanted to go and explore more food choices in Bugis, I ended up getting my smoothie to go. <br&gt;<br&gt;Whoops.. And I checked in after I purchased the smoothie. No more 10% discount :( The drink was served pretty quickly and I left the place within 5 minutes.<br&gt;<br&gt;While walking towards Bugis, I took sips of the smoothie. I asked my friend to taste it first and then I tasted it. After the first sip, it became addictive. It is much better than the real Chendol. The smoothie was blend in perfect amount of ingredients. I could also taste the green colored jelly on it. It was pretty thick smoothie that it took me quite awhile to finish it up.<br&gt;<br&gt;One downside of the smoothie was the straw. They provided the normal straw and a spoon. It would be better if I was given a bubble/boba tea straw so I can consume the corn, the red bean and the green colored jelly together in one go. When I reached bugis, all the heavier ingredients were left behind and I tried eating it with a spoon but it wasn&amp;#39;t as good as the smoothie were gone and the heavier ingredients were left over.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I love the smoothie. Just that it was on the pricier side. Will definitely come back for more rounds of Chendol Smoothies when I am craving for one :)"

Don&amp;#39;t be put off by the roadworks outside, because behind the front door Flee Away is an escape from the noise and heat outside. It&amp;#39;s a cafe, but with a twist. Yes you can eat and drink, but look closer at the menu for a few surprises. And while you&amp;#39;re flexing those eyeballs, look up at the walls and ceilings for old antique trinkets that make you feel like you&amp;#39;re in a child&amp;#39;s bedroom. There are perspex boxes by the front door and inside you will find locally made nick-nacks that you can buy and take home. A great spot for unique gifts with a Singapore flavour.<br&gt;<br&gt;The menu is intriguing. There&amp;#39;s familiar flavours like Chicken Curry and Laksa, but they&amp;#39;re served up in entirely inventive ways. The Chicken Curry &amp;#34;sandwich&amp;#34; was incredibly tasty, though I&amp;#39;m glad to have shared one as it was incredibly rich. I don&amp;#39;t even know what the &amp;#34;bread&amp;#34; was but apparently it&amp;#39;s a well known Chinese food item that is never used in sandwich format. <br&gt;<br&gt;The same innovation extends to the drinks menu, especially the milkshakes.  At Flee Away you can order fun milkshakes like &amp;#34;Happy Birthday&amp;#34; flavour that features cake mix inside. Why eat Red Velvet Cake when you can drink a milkshake that tastes like it? <br&gt;<br&gt;The coffee isn&amp;#39;t going to win any awards for third wave artistry, but it&amp;#39;s passable and comes served in a cute teacup loaded with little lion biscuits in the side. <br&gt;<br&gt;The ambience here is nice, with great music and staff who really want you to have fun and enjoy yourself. You won&amp;#39;t feel bad spending some hours here working or reading, so feel free to bring a book and settle in with some food and drinks."

This was my go to place for coffee in the morning when I was working in the area almost 10 years ago. Then, the menu was smaller and simpler with just the usual toast, soft boiled eggs and coffee or tea. Now you have other typical Singaporean food like laksa, mee siam and mee rebus besides toast. <br&gt;<br&gt;My favorite toast was the peanut butter and honey and I have yet to find this combination at the other coffee toast joints. The coffee is strong but not too acidic bitter strong. <br&gt;<br&gt;My other favorite set would be the otah bun with soft boiled eggs and kopi. I also like how you can choose to have your kaya butter on either soft buns or the thin crispy toast. <br&gt;<br&gt;This is a good alternative to the ever crowded Ya Kun or Toastbox. Cheaper too, I think."

But I came here to check it out but primarily to try their Ice Cheese Tart! Wasn&amp;#39;t feeling a craving for cake, maybe another time. <br&gt;<br&gt;Given it was my first time here I gave their original a try. It was good. A nice almond crust and good balance of not too too sweet cheese filling. It was perfect to eat there because they cut it into fours for you and it doesn&amp;#39;t get warm too quickly, etc. Yum, they had so many other flavors. I&amp;#39;ll definitely be back to try their Earl agree :) <br&gt;<br&gt;Their other cake slices looked a little pricey and small. Their tea was cute in clear glass pots heated by a candle so it wouldn&amp;#39;t get cold. Cool, but not worth $10 for a homemade blend in my opinion. Same with the iced coffee, $8 seems a bit steep for a normal size tall glass. <br&gt;<br&gt;Anyways, the atmosphere was nice, loved how bright and simple the decor was. Overall I feel the patisserie is kind of pricey but it is a specialized niche so I guess it can get by. As I said I&amp;#39;ll be back for their ice cheese tarts :) plus I found the Duxton Hill area is a nice area to walk around too. <br&gt;<br&gt;Tip: come to hang out and share a pot of tea with some nice treats <br&gt;Tip2: no wifi avail<br&gt;Tip3: variety of treats to purchase from full cakes to packaged goodies too."

A few shelves affixed on the wall holds little bags of special cake-slices and cookies which are up for sale, such as walnut cookies, chocolate madeleines, butter cakes, coffee biscuits, sesame cookies, etc. Most of these have a covered bowl of sampling pieces by their side, which is great for curious tasters like myself.<br&gt;<br&gt;The three-tiered display cabinet by the cashier was empty other than the top shelf, which was quite a shame, as options were limited, and it showed. My friend and I went for the mont blanc for $6.95. After unwrapping the surrounding foil, there lay a light yellow sponge cylinder topped with chestnut cream, pierced by chocolate curls and a flaky pastry shard. Unfortunately, the latter was soggy and papery, and I felt that the dessert should have done without it.<br&gt;<br&gt;The taste of the entire cake was extremely subtle, a la Japanese baking style of Chef Yamashita. The first bite didn&amp;#39;t speak much, but the light chestnut flavour came through with more bites, and a single sweet chestnut is later revealed under the carefully-piped cream. Both the texture of the sponge and cream was light and airy, very easy to eat. It was my first time trying a [i]mont blanc[/i], and I quite enjoyed it, but I must say that it was overpriced for its size.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had a bit of my friend&amp;#39;s Wakakusayama, [pause to catch breath] which is a green tea Swiss roll filled with red bean cream, topped with fruits and sweet chestnuts. ($7.30)<br&gt;<br&gt;The flavour of green tea was strong in this cake. Rather heavy, almost bitter, not for those who usually stick to sweet treats. The red bean cream had a lot of authentic red bean taste, which is special to taste. <br&gt;<br&gt;My friends and I decided to share an &amp;#39;Ice Cheese Tart&amp;#39; out of curiosity. Each tart costs $3.40, and has varieties of strawberry, green tea, maple, mango, chocolate &amp;amp; orange, yuzu and caramel, which we ended up choosing.<br&gt;<br&gt;The &amp;#39;Ice Cheese Tart&amp;#39; turned out to be pretty much a frozen mini-cheesecake stuck fast to a paper mould, with an almond biscuit base. It was pretty annoying trying to bite or cut through the rock-solid cheesecake, but we didn&amp;#39;t have patience to wait for it to thaw either.<br&gt;<br&gt;The taste of the cheese tart was striking, and absolutely great. There&amp;#39;s a distinct saltiness in the cream cheese which really improves the flavour of it. I didn&amp;#39;t notice any obvious caramel flavour, but I&amp;#39;m guessing it was infused into the cream cheese somehow. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind going back to try the other flavours, especially maple, but I do wish they would sell these un-frozen!<br&gt;<br&gt;Just when the three of us thought that we&amp;#39;d had enough cake for the day, a tray of Strawberry Soufflé ($6.60) magically appeared on the only-occupied shelf in the display cabinet when it wasn&amp;#39;t there before, threatening to become dessert for our dessert!<br&gt;<br&gt;Gotta have it, we thought. It was okay height-wise, but was a narrow slice. Piled with blueberries and strawberries encased in clear jelly, the cake is made up of a thick middle layer of light, aerated cheesecake topped with chantilly cream and strawberry chunks, all sandwiched between light sponge cake, plus fine biscuit crumbs stuck to the side.<br&gt;<br&gt;It was a very impressive cake, and I loved the hint of lemon in the cheesecake, which gave it a quiet, pleasant tang. Despite it being cheesecake, it was not too rich at all, because of the soufflé technique used to create an airy texture. My friends commented on sour strawberries, but the ones I ate seemed fine. This is a cake I&amp;#39;d come back for, it&amp;#39;s delicious.<br&gt;<br&gt;Due to the long walk under the hot, late-afternoon sun, we each got iced tea to cool ourselves down and quench our thirst. My friends went for green tea, a peach tea, and for myself, a mango tea. ($4.50, except for the green tea which was slightly cheaper)<br&gt;<br&gt;The teas were very pure - teabag, water, ice cubes, and no added sugar. I could barely taste mango in mine, but it was refreshing, nevertheless. The staff at Flor gladly lets you top up the water in your cup, so you can maximise the use of the teabag.<br&gt;<br&gt;We each ended up spending about $15 per person, with all the drinks and shared cakes. Not somewhere one would frequent as a student, but a nice, quiet place to go for an occasional dessert-escapade, especially if you&amp;#39;re into Japanese desserts."

Chestnut mille feuille', 'width': 180, 'height': 180, 'caption': 'Chestnut mille feuille'}]",Cheryl N.,en,"I was surprised to see how small the space is. Some tables and chairs to accommodate 6 and another 3 stools along a small bar counter. Outside the shop, there&amp;#39;re dining space for another 8 perhaps? I reckon it&amp;#39;s more of a bakery for cakes to go. But anyway we decided to camp there for a while to enjoy the cakes.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The green tea cake is very light and this is very typical of Japanese cakes. I love the Japanese cheesecake with that cow logo on it. I can finish at least half a cake in a sitting (i swear it). It doesn&amp;#39;t feel sinful at all. Every mouthful simply disappears into a fragrant mix that glides down your throat. It feels like a dream because you&amp;#39;re not sure if you really did eat it at all. <br&gt;<br&gt;The matcha is strong but not overpowering and the green tea sponge cake was also very airy and moist. I like the green tea jelly which sits on top of the cake. It adds an additional dimension to the creamy texture, kinda chewy but not much? Flor uses the Kyoto-uji matcha for the pristine flavor and aroma and it&amp;#39;s a damn good choice.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Waguri millefeuille was also very nice. Same quality to the sponge cake. I would reckon that their toufu chiffon cake would have the same texture. Z had it before and said that it&amp;#39;s pretty good but pricey for a chiffon cake ($13.80 for 1 if i didn&amp;#39;t remember wrongly). There&amp;#39;s a nice mix of custard and cream with the puff pastry.<br&gt;<br&gt;Typically, a mille-feuille would have 3 layers of pastry and 2 layers of creme but this only has 2 layers of pastry. I&amp;#39;m not too picky about stuff like that. I personally thought this has a nice pastry to cream/cake ratio. Any more and i would feel like i&amp;#39;m trying to sandpaper the insides of the throat.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pastry was well done, has a nice bite to it and wasn&amp;#39;t at all moist or flat from the creme. The chestnut paste goes down really easy. I&amp;#39;ve tried several chestnut based desserts such as the Mont Blanc from Antoinette but they are kinda dense and dry as compared to Flor&amp;#39;s. Z and i had a discussion about the chestnuts that were used to made these desserts and if they differ from those we typically see at the night markets. Think it&amp;#39;s the same?<br&gt;<br&gt;Anyhoo, the cakes didn&amp;#39;t even take up much space in our tummies and we ordered their iced cheese tarts. They have quite a couple of flavors e.g. orange chocolate, caramel, green tea with yuzu and a couple of others. It has an almond cookie base and is filled with a lightly salted cream cheese filling (Flor&amp;#39;s signature) and goes for $3.20 a pop. <br&gt;<br&gt;I would liken the experience to what eating dry ice would be. It simply sublimes in the mouth and vaporizes. Imagine cheese that does that? It absolutely defies logic but it&amp;#39;s really interesting. I was confused and surprised for a bit on my first mouth. We had the caramel one and it wasn&amp;#39;t too sweet (which is great). Go try it for yourself."

Tarts! Cookies! This place is a haven for all with a sweet tooth. Not only will you be able to satisfy your dessert craving here (minus ice-cream though, you&amp;#39;ll have to go to a Cold Stone or a 7-11 for that), you&amp;#39;ll be getting your money&amp;#39;s worth for the quality of each heavenly delight you put into your mouth. Why? Simple, if you&amp;#39;ve been to Japan, you&amp;#39;ll know that their pastries are to die for and lo and behold! Flor Patisserie is a Japanese-styled patisserie serving authentic Japanese inspired French pastry and that&amp;#39;s a mathematical combination that every living, breathing person would know the answer to. <br&gt;<br&gt;Personal favourites for me would be the Earl Grey Choco ($6.95), Marron Pie ($4.50), Madeleine ($2.15/pc, any flavour) &amp;amp; of course, Flor&amp;#39;s signature Ice Cheese Tarts ($3.40/pc, 9 flavours to choose from -  for all cheese lovers, its frozen cheese on a tart, heaven! )<br&gt;<br&gt;According to the description on the website, the Earl Grey Choco is a &amp;#34;Delicate earl grey cream piped onto swiss roll of dark chocolate meringue and sweet banana&amp;#34; - it&amp;#39;s pretty much that except this written description doesn&amp;#39;t exactly give you the idea of how soft and airy the texture is, despite having a meringue casing around it. The Earl Grey cream is not too rich which makes it easier to go with the candied bananas. I actually raved about this one slice so much that my friends got me a whole roll for my birthday one of the years, much to my delight - we should all embrace getting a year older with some good cake! <br&gt;<br&gt;The Marron Pie (it&amp;#39;s muffin sized)  was an interesting surprise for me personally. I&amp;#39;m not much of a chestnut fan so when I first discovered that there was a chestnut in the heart of this, I pretty much passed on the idea. But my friend, who introduced the place to me, kept raving about it and described how she would savour this (nibbling on it for hours apparently), I thought I&amp;#39;d give it a go and if i didn&amp;#39;t like it, my late-mother was a fan of chestnuts so she could have it. Unfortunately for her, it never made it home. <br&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;Description: Buttery fragrant almond cream baked in crunchy puff pastry cup with sweetened japanese chestnut center.&amp;#34; Damn right, it&amp;#39;s as tasty as that! But don&amp;#39;t let the word &amp;#39;buttery&amp;#39; fool ya, it&amp;#39;s not overwhelming, unlike some other baked goods I&amp;#39;ve tried. Instead, the butter is more like a coat over the crunchiness of the puff pastry and the almond cream which combined together, does a good number on your taste buds, that just leaves you yearning for more. Not fantastic for the waistline because this thing is HUGE but if you have a little fat girl inside you somewhere, you should be nice and treat her to a something every now and then &amp;amp; I highly recommend this to be it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Madeleine. This brings me to my unique experience as well but first,  these are not at all dry and the chocolate ones are moist, almost similar to a brownie or a chocolate lava cake minus the lava. Back to the story, at one point,  they were selling the Madeleines in the shape of bears, individually wrapped which was adorable and so, I decided to buy some back. That same evening, I discovered mold on one of the bear&amp;#39;s ear and decided to let them know about it. I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting anything but I just thought I&amp;#39;d let them know of my find. I called the very next day and to my surprise, I got a tonne of sincerely apologetic replies back, it almost made me feel bad for making the call. They offered to give me something for free on my next visit but I wasn&amp;#39;t gonna be going back anytime within that week so I just left it. On my next visit however, the Madeleines were back to being the shell shaped ones and so I briefly mentioned the bears and that I found mold on one of them once. THAT immediately sparked an wave of acknowledgment around the room and after discussing amongst themselves, the lady serving me apologized and gave me another Madeleine free to make up for it, shortly after, the chef himself came out from the kitchen to apologize and explained that it was an error on their part for not sealing the packaging properly, resulting in the air to enter the pack and thus, mold. I thought that that was VERY professional of them to acknowledge this and to even have the chef himself come out personally. Needless to say, as with all Japanese service staff, everyone (including the chef), saw me out of the cafe before resuming their respective duties. <br&gt;<br&gt;Like I said, it has been awhile since I&amp;#39;ve been back there &amp;amp; i do believe the prices have increased a little.

Lightly salted with truffle salt, that&amp;#39;s pretty much they have to offer here at The Assembly Ground.

Both were served in mason jars &amp;amp; looked very thin and watery but quite tasty and light! Very refreshing. Also shared brownies, a popular item on the menu according to the friendly staff, which were delicious ($6.50). I was craving a coffee so I also ordered an iced latte ($8), which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream inside. I was a little disappointed about the size of this - it&amp;#39;s a small glass maybe 8oz? (Def smaller than the Tall at Starbucks). But the coffee was strong and good. <br&gt;<br&gt;The baked goods at the counter (not in the refrigerater) are freshly homemade: selections included Thai milk tea cake, brownies, citrus loaf, and they looked very good!!"

That is the standout dish as most other things are pretty average.

This is a review on their The Assembly Wagyu Burger ($24.50). I don&amp;#39;t really like beef, but I ordered their wagyu burger nonetheless cos I heard some good reviews about it. I am so glad that I did take a chance cos their wagyu burger was really good. All the burgers menu was served with sesame brioche bun + spiced fries. The sesame brioche bun was very very good. It was toasted with just enough butter, and it was still warm though it had been sitting for more than 10 mins after being served. Since it comes with fries, so for girls, you might have some difficulty to finish this dish. I came there HUNGRY (it was past 12 pm and I haven&amp;#39;t eaten anything since morning) and yet I couldn&amp;#39;t finish the dish. But I guess being served too much food is better than being served too little food, right? ;p<br&gt;<br&gt;About the wagyu beef patty it was very thick - however texture wise it was perfect. I could easily cut &amp;amp; chew it with no problem at all. No complains. Taste wise it was very good as well. It was juicy and just right salty. Though I really like this dish overall very much, I can testify that the fries (though also tasted good) but was loaded with lots of MSG (I got very very thirsty afterwards) drinking like 6 cups of water total. So if you were on diet, it&amp;#39;s probably a good idea to just skip the fries and go straight to the burger. <br&gt;<br&gt;My hubby got Ragout of Beef with Rosti (S$23). Based on the menu description, it was slow-roasted angus, rosti, trio of mushrooms, onion jam, creamed spinach, &amp;amp; 62C egg. When it came to our table, the smell was very nice and tempting. However when it comes to the taste, the beef was very lacking. In conclusion, if you&amp;#39;re feeling to eat smth beef-y, I vote for the wagyu beef burger all the way!<br&gt;<br&gt;Last but not least the place has ample seating space. They also offer free wifi for customers, however when I tried it (Assembly 1) it doesn&amp;#39;t work... :/ [came here on July 11]"

While I know their coffee is recommended, I&amp;#39;ve never been a huge fan of coffee. So, I hesitated ordering a cup expecting my coffee addict of a boyfriend to order one that I can try a tiny bit of. However, he surprised me by ordering a pint...a latte it was for me, and a good thing I did too. The coffee was a good blend in my opinion, less acidic and with a great robust flavour. The milk tasted somewhat creamy which made me slightly suspicious but all in all, it was a good drink. My friend also seemed to thoroughly enjoy her ice chocolate, for those who don&amp;#39;t particularly like coffee. I had the coney dog, while my boyfriend had the blackened tuna burger and my friend ordered the beef ragout with rosti. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say it was spectacular, just a regular frankfurter it seems with a slightly sweeter than expected beef chilli but it fulfilled my chilli dog craving and as such, I&amp;#39;d give it 3 stars. The remaining star comes from the fact that my companions seemed to quite enjoy their food and the decent portions, and we were served by an exceptionally friendly waiter, who was key to our whole experience being delightful overall. To that waiter, you might think you&amp;#39;re just doing your job but thank you for doing it so well!"

But, they just don&amp;#39;t taste as good compared to the ones in Singapore. I have to get their Kopi-C here, which is basically their blend of aromatic coffee with creamy and sweet condensed milk. Better than any Starbucks chain. <br&gt;<br&gt;As for their breakfast options, I really don&amp;#39;t go for their sweet options. I have tried most of their savory items. My favorite items to order for a hearty breakfast were their Nasi Lemak, Curry Chicken Rice, and my sister&amp;#39;s favorite, their braised pork over rice with a roasted chicken leg on the side. All of these dishes were brimming with flavor and packed a wonderful punch. I appreciated that the rice that came with these dishes was aromatic and not mushy. Other noteworthy dishes that were pretty good were their laksa and mee goreng. The noodles in the laksa were broken up into pieces for easy eating. But, this didn&amp;#39;t allow much of that laksa broth flavor to be absorbed. We just prefer their spaghetti type noodles more, as far as flavor and texture goes. The laksa broth was also a little bit too creamy from all the coconut milk, in our opinion. The mee goreng noodles were a bit over cooked when I tried it, and the flavor was a little overpowering for me from that shrimp paste. Definitely, cut that strong flavor with the calamansi provided. The pan fried spam was the star of the show in the mee goreng dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, Toast Box is just a wonderful and consistent food option in Singapore to eat breakfast or lunch. It would be dangerous to have a Toast Box close to home, since I practically ate Toast Box almost every morning. Not necessarily good for that waistline. Lol. At least I can splurge on my diet while in Singapore. They&amp;#39;re practically everywhere in Singapore (like an Asian McDonald&amp;#39;s). It&amp;#39;s worth mentioning that their savory items are $8 USD or less. If you&amp;#39;re ever visiting, come check them out."

The pho bo is distinctly lacking in these, as is their fresh spring roll. However, I was quite pleased with their bun with fried spring rolls, and I think I&amp;#39;ll stick with this one the next time I go. <br&gt;<br&gt;They have great deals at lunchtime - SGD 9 for a main, drink and ice-cream - and happy hour on their beers and ciders in the early evenings.

Haven&amp;#39;t tried food items. <br&gt;<br&gt;I go to church near this place so have come here several times for our small group over coffee drinks. I was not impressed and thought the drinks were so dull and the place was simply not worth my time putting it into a review. But oh boy did today change everything! <br&gt;<br&gt;I had a chance to try their cinnamon bun thanks to my friend and I was in love. Maybe I haven&amp;#39;t found too many good bread places yet, but I really appreciated the made-from-scratch, fluffy texture that lived inside the bread with just a dash of cinnamon instead of being smothered with it. (Yes, I am a sucker for such delicacy,) <br&gt;<br&gt;So I wanted to bring back home the bun but the cinnamon bun was already all sold out by the time I left. So I chose milk plait as an alternative and it was also really good. But 3.5/5 goodness, not exactly 4. But again the texture was just so right. Couldn&amp;#39;t stop myself from eating almost entirely to continue ripping the bread to its texture.<br&gt;<br&gt;My friend told me that their baguette and ciabatta, rustic bread are all really good.

My friend and I bought a baguette ($3++) and requested for it to be sliced (it was pretty rock hard), and was told that each slice would cost an additional $1. I have no idea why we decided it was still a good idea to go ahead- probably we were afraid of tearing our teeth out with the bread if we were to dissect it ourselves. Anyway, the eventual cost added up to more than $11.. 300% off the original price, just for the slicing alone. Up till this day, I still cannot decide if we were being ridiculous (I think so) to have gone ahead with it or that the restaurant was ridiculous in coming up with such a surcharge, bearing in mind it was empty when we were and the slicing (by the machine, may I add) took all of 30 seconds.

The food is decently good for a brunch date / with family.<br&gt;<br&gt;I love that they still kept their self-serve froyo concept at the back of the store even after changing the style of the outlet. Ask for sample cups if you want to try any of the new flavours! They also have an interesting mochi waffle that you can order together with your froyo/ice cream!<br&gt;<br&gt;If you ever need to rent a space, they also have a second floor that is able to host a good number of people for an event. <br&gt;<br&gt;Parking right outside the store is limited (perhaps less than 10 lots).

A little while later (maybe 15 minutes or so), a group of people form MediaCorp came into the cafe. We thought they were just stopping by to grab something to eat, little did we know they were going to film. We were approached by the staff to tell us that we needed to keep quiet while they were filming. <br&gt;It was a really unpleasant lunch as we kept getting stared at when we were eating (it&amp;#39;s not like we can help it when our utensils hit the plates/bowls). <br&gt;We would have appreciated it if the staff had informed us of the filming before we ordered so that we could decide if we wanted to go somewhere else or continue to eat there in silence."

(vs my fave ma la style steamboat - that would be Hai Di Lao or Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao). <br&gt;<br&gt;I usually the tom yum and non-spicy chicken soup. The tom yum soup is thai-style, spicy and sour without being overbearing. Of course, the soup becomes denser after meat slices and other ingredients stew in it, and gets tastier and tastier. The chicken soup is alright, nothing spectacular but it does the job. They have plenty of the usual steamboat dishes like beef, chicken, etc slices, dumplings, veggies like cabbage, winter melon, potato and so on, and they also have fish glue. The staff squeeze it out and use a pair of scissors to snip off pieces into the soup, just the way it should be done! <br&gt;<br&gt;The fried calamari was surprisingly light and good. We ordered it according to the server&amp;#39;s recommendation, initially a little skeptical, but it was such a great decision. It didn&amp;#39;t taste oily as fried food often does. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve come here with fellow interns too and they had a fantastic lunch set that 5 of us shared, that I unfortunately can&amp;#39;t remember the particulars of.

We ordered Fried Hokkien Noodles, Char Kuay Teow, White Fried Carrot Cake and Chicken Curry Noodles.the Char Kuay Teow was well done but lacked cockles, as stated in the menu.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Fried Hokkien Noodles is unlike what you usually get at the hawker centre. It didn&amp;#39;t have any gravy, but tastes great anyways.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The curry chicken noodles was unlike what was shown on the menu. On the menu, the chicken were in shreds but when it was served, it was 2 large pieces of chicken thighs with the bone in. This made it very awkward to eat. The noodles didn&amp;#39;t seem to have been blanched beforehand so they were quite dry in the gravy. The gravy was very tasty but a little too thick for my liking. Overall, it was still a pretty good dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;The worst dish was the fried carrot cake. I ordered it as I saw someone at the next table having it and it looked great. But when it came, the carrot cake itself tasted sour, like it was old. My kids usually devour this but rejected this for the first time. I returned it to the kitchen and saw that the diners on the next table had left and barely touched theirs. I figured they must have had the same problem. They brought a fresh plate out for me and apologised. There were still some bits in there that tasted off, but they were mostly okay. By that time I was too full from lunch that I didn&amp;#39;t finish the dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;I thought the dishes on the menu looked great but the actual dishes kinda fell short in small ways."

As if not everyone already know, Henri Charpentier is not the owner or related to this chain of bakery. The owner, a Japanese, was fascinated with the Crêpe Suzette created by the late French chef hence named the first Café (established in Ashiya in 1969) after him. <br&gt;<br&gt;Since the one at Ion Orchard has not officially opened, my sis and I made plans to meet at the location at Orchard Central on Saturday at 1pm. <br&gt;<br&gt;AMBIENCE 3/5<br&gt;There was not much ambience going on. There are just essentially like 3-4 tables (plastic kind) and chairs are not the comfy kind. To be honest, I like my café in a enclosed setting. <br&gt;<br&gt;SERVICE 4/5<br&gt;Staff was very nice and patient. I was looking around, opted for a financier, then added a soufflé cheesecake and a iced tea. I arrived there before my sister, I wanted to order something and then grab a table since seatings are a premium. I probably took quite a while, my sis came from behind and tried to scare me :D silly sis!! Then she added another dunno what kind of cake and a iced coffee. <br&gt;Maybe it was good she showed up before the staff rang up all my order, cos she went like she would pay. Hahaha!! Thank you sis!!! <br&gt;<br&gt;Then I realized staff did not give me any syrup for my iced tea. Hence -1.<br&gt;<br&gt;FOOD 4/5<br&gt;Hmmm... I was not wowed by the financier or the soufflé cheesecake. I definitely have better pastries elsewhere. <br&gt;<br&gt;I will definitely check out the new location when it opens at Ion Orchard. Hopefully it will open before I head back to Atlanta in July."

More often than not, we see a lot of these artisanal gelato places try to offer as many flavours as they can, and more often than not, a lot of the flavours fall short.  <br&gt;Not here. While they may not have the biggest variety (it&amp;#39;s still very substantial at about 15 flavours? I think), they do these 15 flavours well. <br&gt;After sampling a few, we decided to go with Strawberry and Oat and Mascarpone. <br&gt;The strawberry and oat was very pleasant and not overly sweet. It didn&amp;#39;t taste overly sweetened or overly artificial and the oats ended a nice texture and chewiness to the ice-cream. <br&gt;<br&gt;The mascarpone was very good too. Lightly sweetened, the mascarpone was smooth, not overly rich, and tested almost..... refreshing (I know, cheese? Refreshing?). It was like a scoop of fluffy Hokkaido cheesecake but milder in the cheese flavour (Mascarpone after all is a little on the tasteless side). <br&gt;<br&gt;Amazingly, by combining both, we noticed tha it wasted a lot like a very yummy, strawberry cheesecake. Brilliant! <br&gt;<br&gt;And what went fantastically well with the gelato?<br&gt;<br&gt;Waffle Fingers ($4.00)<br&gt;How clever. &amp;#34;Sticks&amp;#34; of wonderfully cooked waffles that were freshly made to order, very tasty on its own, paired with a syringe of maple syrup, and mixed in with the yumminess of the ice-cream. A wonderful combination that spells HAPPY. <br&gt;<br&gt;Latte ($4.50)<br&gt;As if the gelato wasn&amp;#39;t good enough, it helped that they had really good coffee too. Coffee was rich, not overly acidic and a joy to have with the gelato. <br&gt;<br&gt;Butterscotch Steamer ($4.00) <br&gt;A little piece of heaven discovered by the wife. A little sweet for me but if you love Butterscotch you will definitely love this. <br&gt;The drink is one of those that, with each sip, you imagine yourself in a nice wooden cottage in winter, sitting by the fire and sipping a cup of butterscotch milk with a loved one, feeling that warm fuzzy feeling inside. <br&gt;<br&gt;This has to be the nicest ice cream / artisanal gelato places we&amp;#39;ve had in a very long time. <br&gt;Like their website says, their job is to make people happy and make people happy the do! <br&gt;<br&gt;Do note that their flavours are seasonal and they will constantly change and update what&amp;#39;s available. <br&gt;We&amp;#39;re waiting for the Carrot cake flavour to return!"

Or at least in Singapore. Since it&amp;#39;s debut in June 2019 last year with its first outlet in Kampong Glam, the famous HK coffee chain has branched out to Orchard Central (2nd branch) and just last week - Chip Bee Gardens in Holland Village, it&amp;#39;s 3rd branch. All within 6 months. WOW! <br&gt;<br&gt;Arabica coffee originates from HK but later made famous in Kyoto after the owner partners with a world champion barista. So now, everyone flocks to its Kyoto branch just to see this guy pull his shot and be mesmerized by his latte art. But then again, Arabica coffee has a huge following worldwide, people actually travel the world to drink their coffee and to pose with the famous &amp;#34;%&amp;#34; logo. Ok, we&amp;#39;re done with history lesson!  <br&gt;<br&gt;Now back to this branch in Chip Bee Gardens. The coffee shop is located along the stretch of restaurants behind the main road, next to Baker &amp;amp; Cook.  As you walk inside, you&amp;#39;ll be greeted with a huge, all WHITE minimalist counter for you to place your order. For you coffee elitists, sorry to inform you that they don&amp;#39;t do pour-overs, only the usual latte, mocha, and even matcha latte. But hey, coffee&amp;#39;s good despite the high price tag. There&amp;#39;s also a limited choice of pastries if you fancy a bite to go with your coffee. But i would say, stick to your new year&amp;#39;s resolution, stay away from gluten and cut down on carbs. <br&gt;<br&gt;It will be interesting to see how they survive in the next coming months as there are many coffee options around the neighborhood. But knowing Singapore, a society driven by commercial brands, Arabica would definitely survive in the Hunger Games of Coffee. <br&gt;<br&gt;I am torn in between a 3 and a 4-star review. Arabica totally deserves more than 3 stars but might be too early for a 4. According to Yelp guidelines, 4 stars mean &amp;#34;Yay, I&amp;#39;m a fan&amp;#34; and yes, I am so ill leave it as it is!"

Its my own fault and i probably had a mini seizure while ordering.  I saw the tuna melt at the table next to us and it looked GOOD.  <br&gt;<br&gt;I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The owner seemed really nice and friendly.  The service was good. The coffee was very good.  The location as nice but a little hidden. I honestly had never noticed it before.  I really like places that have an interesting menu.  The items seem fun.  I enjoyed it but felt like I had been nominated for an award but didnt actually win it.  I think I need to go back for dinner. The chili crab mac and cheese and the tuna melt are something I&amp;#39;m super curious to try.  I will need to try it again.

I love you, Sweets and I&amp;#39;m sorry it took me so long to finally come and sit down for a proper dinner. <br&gt;<br&gt;Beyond all the great reviews that everyone has been ranting about, I really enjoy the atmosphere and warm hospitality by everyone. The food served are rich and supple, servings are very generous, just as Ju says &amp;#34;My servings are very generous, just like me!&amp;#34; ;)<br&gt;<br&gt;I had the Ju&amp;#39;s Prawn Pappardelle, while my friends has the Spiced Beef Burger and the Prawn Burger. The Burgers were served with Garlic fries, a great complement to lift the tastes of the burgers further. I cant comment on the burgers cos I havent tasted them, but for someone who doesnt usually have creamy pasta, the Prawn pappardelle was awesome. Rich but not overpowering, Ju managed to ensure that the pasta was still kept Al Dente even when it&amp;#39;s soaked in the creamy prawn sauce.<br&gt;<br&gt;For desserts, we had the Blueberry Lemon Cake and the Lemon Meringue Pie. The cakes here are big. The textures feel more like pound cakes rather than sponge cakes cos every mouth of cake is full and supple. Love the blueberry jam in between the layers of lemon cake as they complement each other perfectly with the sweetness of the blueberry jam and light lemon flavour. The lemon meringue pie had a really good balance of the sour lemon curd and the light meringue. The tart was buttery and give a good bite to the creamy tart.<br&gt;<br&gt;With all the good food, the only downer is the size of the table. I wished they were slightly bigger to contain all the awesome-ness on the table. :P<br&gt;<br&gt;For those who of you who has yet to try, head down soon! For those who love this place, good news is, they are going to undergo a little reno in Feb 14 and reopen with a even more hearty menu. Cant Wait!"

Would recommend this - not that it&amp;#39;s super tasty but more so for its unique taste. <br&gt;<br&gt;The lime pie was really good! You could tell the love for this pie by the speed it disappeared from the plate.

Don&amp;#39;t reinvent the wheel.&amp;#34; Those were the thoughts that ran through my head as i sat through the preview of The Fabulous Baker Boy&amp;#39;s new dinner menu. If only Juwanda were to stick to his brunch fare and cakes, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure people would love to have that for dinner as well.<br&gt;<br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with my favorite part of the meal- the cakes. TFBB is known for their cakes and while there were hits and misses (Green Tea Praline was too dry, Red Velvet a tad sweet), the latest addition, the Pam D&amp;#39;OR stole the limelight. This cake was created in honor of Juwanda&amp;#39;s muse, actress Pamela Oei, a dear friend of his. <br&gt;<br&gt;What&amp;#39;s better than sticky date pudding? A sticky date cake sandwiched with layers of butterscotch and cream cheese. Oh brown sugar, latte butter cream, and Valrhona chocolate. This cake wouldn&amp;#39;t always be available in store but i think it should be made a staple. A 3kg 9&amp;#34; cake will set you back by $105 and each slice is $10. Love this one!<br&gt;<br&gt;Back to the dinner menu, skip the salads and starters as they are quite blah. The Almond Encrusted Salmon with a mango hollandaise ($22) had several decent elements, such as the fragrant fat-free mango hollandaise sauce that had just a hint of sweetness. The salmon was a little overcooked but still palatable and would certainly do well with more sauce. The contrasting textures could be enhanced with a creamier spinach rather than one that looked like it came through the cold pressed machine but the flavor of the veg was on point.<br&gt;<br&gt;I thought the Duck Confit ($21) was regular and by regular i do mean that it&amp;#39;s not too bad. One of the more flavorful dishes of the night and the plus points were that it was fork tender and not too dry. I liked the cranberry plum compote that accompanied the duck.<br&gt;<br&gt;Steak Frites ($25) 230g NZ grass fed sirloin, grilled on the griddle, dressed with mushrooms and caramelised onions and the horrible fries. No comments on this one as it was forgettable. The fries were just horrid i can&amp;#39;t even begin to describe them (gosh the oil).<br&gt;<br&gt;Serious room for improvement in the Fish Burger ($14.50). The components that i liked about this dish don&amp;#39;t maketh a burger- the tangy Siracha tartar sauce, hint of curry leaves in the batter and the buttery billowing brioche. The batter needs to be WAAAY thinner and the fish needs more flavor on its own. Comes with the same horrible fries. <br&gt;<br&gt;The bastardized Fried Chicken &amp;amp;amp; Waffles ($21) which was served with a half chicken. The horrors!!! Always chicken fillet. ONLY chicken fillet. I didn&amp;#39;t like this dish due to the super hard and dense waffle and the overdose of syrup on this one (it was already drenched when served). TFBB definitely needs to work this one out man. That said, the meat was sufficiently moist though the buttermilk flavor could be enhanced.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well well, that&amp;#39;s my honest take on TFBB&amp;#39;s dinner menu. Honestly i&amp;#39;m pretty certain customers would be happy with an all day brunch menu here with some heartier options. I do hope they work things the kinks out for dinner. In the meantime, be glad that you can now enjoy a slice (or two) with the extended opening hours at TFBB!"

I expect a fairly high standard if you describe yourself as fabulous, and those expectations were certainly bumped out by the display of more than ten cakes. all tall, all colorful, and as easily orderable as they are pinterest-able.<br&gt;<br&gt;but the flavors? non-existing. the only thing you could taste was the dry sponge that seemed to make a showing in both our slices, a stale sort of crumbly butter cake. the icing was essentially colored-but-barely-flavored buttercream<br&gt;<br&gt;we took a mouthful each, and stopped after the first bite.<br&gt;<br&gt;so the meal is marked for me by our leftover slices of cake - which almost never happens. most slices of cake still turn out pretty much edible: it&amp;#39;s just butter, sugar and sweet stuff, no? but these were so bad we couldn&amp;#39;t ourselves to eat anymore - which is when we headed to the lovely drury lane for a brunch part two.<br&gt;<br&gt;I would steer clear. even their coffee choices are small and apparently tastes just as mediocre - so not even worth a suggestion for a sit-down for a cuppa. wholly disappointing - and I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;ve had my brunch plans so thwarted in a long time."

I&amp;#39;ve posted this review in HungryGoSomewhere and didn&amp;#39;t get a response from the owner. Now with Yelp in Singapore, I need to continue to share my experience.<br&gt;<br&gt;They have a great location - I had no clue where &amp;#34;The Foothills&amp;#34; even was? A friend told me that it was near Liang Court but across the street...where? The cafe is super cute. No boring mall location here. It&amp;#39;s tucked away in a side of Fort Canning Park. Ample, comfortable seating. Cute decor - doesn&amp;#39;t look Ikea to me. Oh and their cakes are super attractive looking. If you wanted a beautiful cake for a kids party, adult tea gig, heck, probably even a wedding, this is the place to come (notice that said pretty...which doesn&amp;#39;t mean delicious or tasty). <br&gt;<br&gt;That&amp;#39;s about where the compliments end.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had this cake a friend&amp;#39;s birthday party and it was decorated like Cookie Monster. There was even a cookie hanging out of the side of Cookie Monster&amp;#39;s face. Looked like a winner to me (remember, I said beautiful cake?). We cut it up and passed around sliced. The icing, I think, was a buttercream that tasted only of butter and maybe a teaspoon of sugar. The best way to describe it would be to imagine mixing a can of Crisco and four sticks of butter together. Now add two teaspoons of sugar. Drown in Smuft blue food coloring. That&amp;#39;s the icing.<br&gt;<br&gt;On to the cake. The one we had was a salted caramel chocolate. Cake was tasteless and dry. I appreciated that it came in three layers with caramel in between, which that was nicely flavored. But the caramel wasn&amp;#39;t enough to carry the weak, dry cake, along with lardy icing.<br&gt;<br&gt;Even after this bad experience that left everyone&amp;#39;s teeth a bright blue, I wanted to give it another shot for a baby shower I was hosting. The cake&amp;#39;s presentation was super attractive - I can&amp;#39;t fault it for that. Really, it&amp;#39;s an impressive looking cake.<br&gt;<br&gt;The following day, I went to the outlet on River Valley. I walked inside of the restaurant and there were three employees there: two friendly women and a shortish man who I can only assume is the &amp;#34;fabulous baker&amp;#34;, owner, or boss during the shift. I asked if I could buy a cake and was told that I needed to order three days in advance. Cool, that&amp;#39;s fine. But then I started asking questions about the cakes in the fridge and none of the three associates wanted to help me. What flavor are these? No response. How many flavors do you have? No response. I&amp;#39;m not sure why these associates froze up or acted awkwardly to my questions.<br&gt;<br&gt;I still wanted a cake. I asked if the cakes in the fridge were spoken for. Again, I got stares. Blinks. I pointedly asked the ladies and they told me to ask the shortish man. He said that they weren&amp;#39;t but were to be served in the restaurant, as guests ordered them, sliced. Then I asked that, hypothetically, what if I wanted to buy the ten or twelve slices that would consist of a cake, could he serve them to me. He said that I needed to order cakes three days in advance. Broken record? I heard you the first time, shortish man. In the end, he caved and said that if someone were to come in and ask for ten slices, he would have to sell them to that person.<br&gt;<br&gt;So then I asked for ten or twelve slices of the cake in the fridge that weren&amp;#39;t spoken for. The ladies stared at me again and kept blinking. I pressed the question again and they pointed to the shortish man. The shortish man just said he couldn&amp;#39;t sell me the cake. I walked to the door and asked again if they were sure that they didn&amp;#39;t want to sell me the slices and that I would tell my friends and blog about it; this was their last chance to remedy the bad experience I&amp;#39;d had. The shortish man said that no, he was not going to sell me the slices.<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all. Great looking cake that tasted sub-par. And horrible service. In Singapore, there are so many great bakeries now. PV Plain Vanilla serves a kick butt cupcake in Holland Village, OKB on Kampong Bahru has the best brownie I&amp;#39;ve probably had in my life, and then you even have Twelve Cupcakes that has recipes for the &amp;#34;Asian palette&amp;#34;. Against these folks, it&amp;#39;s going to be stiff competition for Fabulous Baker Boy."

And guess what, they don&amp;#39;t even charge us for that. (You will get the joke when you get there.)<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Although you might miss the place the 1st few times you pass by but you will never miss it again if you visited it once. It&amp;#39;s actually right opposite Liang Court which means all you have to do is take the MRT to Clarke Quay and cross the road. Simple right? <br&gt;<br&gt;5. If the place, the service, price and the food is right, why only 4/5? You didn&amp;#39;t ask but I&amp;#39;m saying anyway. It&amp;#39;s a shame that they only have 1 beer type and 1 cider at this place, when asked, Haryanto mentioned that they have issues with keep a big amount of stock there. tsk tsk. What a shame. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I think everyone should at least visit the place once. Cause that is all it takes to get you there again. If you are a fan of &amp;#34;The Pigeon Hole&amp;#34; you will definitely like this place. Of course, &amp;#34;TPH&amp;#34; sells a lot more type of drinks."

(i.e. the opld river valley swimming complex) thanks to google i manage to figure it out<br&gt;<br&gt;~ambiance wise~ <br&gt;i would say its more like a tuck shop (i.e toa payoh swimming pool&amp;#39;s tuckshop) there is a choice between indoors and outdoors. Even thou we choose indoors it was still rather humid/hot, and i was like sweating while i was indoors. Outdoor wise i would say even if they had fans they weren&amp;#39;t as powerful to cool someone down. I was there around 2 - 4pm. <br&gt;<br&gt;~Service wise~ <br&gt;its abit haphazard, in the sense that going there first they tell you to get a seat, then after they tell you to order at the counter. (most people would expect you to give them a menu if asked to take a seat?). Menu wise rather unprofessional, i mean having a menu printed out and pinned on a board shows the lack of professionalism. i would rather they have wrote it on a black board then printed on paper making it seems so not serious about their food.<br&gt;<br&gt;~Price wise~<br&gt;for the same price i think i rather go to TCC/coffee club or some restaurant  in liang court. It&amp;#39;s probbly going to be a try once never go again (unless someone else is paying....) <br&gt;<br&gt;~Table wise~ <br&gt;try to avoid the indoors the table is too narrow. My other qualms about the service, Water. basically each table was given water, but maybe cos they lack organisation or were really busy water came to us much later in the meal. (If i didn;t have my own bottle of water i probably would have choke, thou i must say its illogical that the water for 3 people came after the tea i ordered, what happened was a mix of chaos  and lack of a proper system) I witness some other table&amp;#39;s order missing a sausage and stuff (food processing wise i would say they really lack organisation, i mean they asked if we wanted our cake with the food (again what kinda question is this??) and we opted to have it after the food, and they forgot about it, since they processed the first part and threw away the order chit, so when it came to our cakes we have to tell them and get the excuse that they forgot... *sighs*)<br&gt;<br&gt;~Food Wise~<br&gt;The only thing they had going for them was the food, i had egg Benedict, it was really tasty but proportion wise i would preferred if their cakes were a bit smaller. I would not recommend going for 2 course (I can really eat, but having both the egg Benedict and the carrot cake really made me skipped dinner)<br&gt;<br&gt;~Cake wise~ <br&gt;i had the chance to try 3 of them. their famous red velvet, their carrot cake and their lemon vanilla rasberry. i would say i found their carrot the best, some how the previous reviews had stated their red velvet was nice but i found both the red velvet and Lemon vanilla a tad too dry.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall i would say its a nice place to go in the evening for tea (after 5 perhaps?) but they fact that when they got busy it shows their lack of a system in place to deal with the orders and the amount of people reflects that there is a lack of organisation.<br&gt;<br&gt;this place needs a lot of improvements for it to succeed in the long run."

A whole box will only set you back $10, depending on how much you get, I think a good 8 pieces would set you back $10-$12. Which is not so bad.

See, I&amp;#39;m literate so I read signs, but two tourists walked in, took a look, and declared, &amp;#34;No food!&amp;#34; and left the bookstore and cafe EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE LOAVES OF BREAD AND PASTRIES ON DISPLAY.<br&gt;<br&gt;I think these days advertising really needs to be in-your-face to succeed, not subtle. A pity.<br&gt;<br&gt;I will be back! Even though I am not great at Chinese."

The ambience is great for catch up with friends over a drink. <br&gt;<br&gt;We&amp;#39;ve ordered our main courses all from the promo menu and truffle Parmesan fries. It took close to 20 mins before the fries arrived followed by pasta and burger. The Pork neck grill took another 10 mins to be delivered. Sadly, the burger and the Pork neck was more salty than needed while the pasta is blend. We are more sad that with all the truffle shavings on the pasta and pork neck, we can&amp;#39;t smell the truffles. Which is very unusual as this is not the first time we&amp;#39;ve had truffle dishes. <br&gt;<br&gt;Even with the promotion, each dish is about $28. And for that price, I don&amp;#39;t see the value when I have the 3 small pieces of pork neck done like schnitzels, topped with creamy sauce and potato chips that occupied half of the plate. We couldn&amp;#39;t finish our food because I get tired chewing the pork neck and the pasta was too blend to warrant anymore consumption. The saving grace is the burger because it&amp;#39;s not too big and, the parmesan fries has a very nice truffle mayo dip. <br&gt;<br&gt;I really want this place to work out better for customers because they are in a very nice location and the decor is great! <br&gt;<br&gt;I re"

It did look like it had a nice brunch menu, and their burger offerings for dinner looked quite nice. At around 6:30 PM however, they shut off most of the lights, which I think was a real mood killer. No need to have lighting resembling that of a sketchy club, when you are in a nice café where people want to go to talk each other, and in fact, see each other too."

Ever since my first visit back in 2012, I&amp;#39;ve revisited a couple of times may it be for a quick bite or just a couple of after-work drinks with my colleagues. <br&gt;<br&gt;Two Sundays ago, me and 2 other friends decided to visit the restaurant for a casual brunch and to try out some new items in their brunch &amp;#34;tartines&amp;#34; menu. We reached at around 12-ish and were greeted by the manager in charge, Max. The restaurant recently underwent some minor &amp;#34;face lifts&amp;#34; with nicely upholstered chair and the addition of 2 very modern / zen centerpiece. But what makes this place so inviting anytime of the day is the beautiful natural light that shines through the glass panels from one side of the restaurant. The other side of the restaurant faces the &amp;#34;jungle&amp;#34; gives it a cooling and relaxing effect while you dine in.<br&gt;<br&gt;For drinks, M and S ordered mocktails each while I opted for a cocktail (of course.. by any given chance to get drunk on a Sunday) . Their mocktails were refreshingly while my sea salt and chili margarita totally woke me up from my half-sleepy state. Not too strong but still with a kick. Love the Ron Julio Reposado tequila they use as the base. <br&gt;<br&gt;We had seared scallop Carpaccio and beet-cured king salmon for starters. The bright color of the king salmon (from the beet) got us asking for more while we polished that plate of scallop carpaccio within minutes. Both starters were light, flavourful and perfect start to the afternoon.  For mains, we had a plate of crackling suckling pig and grilled french quail to share.  While we all agree that the mains should be bigger in portion, the flavors were spot on and the accompaniment definitely elevated the dish. The suckling pig was amazingly good with mashed sauerkraut and mustard while the grilled quail comes with bits of bacon sprinkled all over it. <br&gt;<br&gt;From the newly brunch tartines menu, we tried 2 items - one savoury and one sweet. For savoury, we had braised whole egg plant with onion, garlic and tomatoes with pine nuts. I might be slightly biased and you can just grill an eggplant with salt and I would say it&amp;#39;s good. This one was phenomenal. For sweet, we had a bostock brioche with almond cream paired with prune and almagnac ice cream. Typing the description itself makes me really hungry now. FML.  And if you&amp;#39;re here, this is something I would highly recommend you order.<br&gt;<br&gt;For desserts, we felt that the poached pear was slightly undercook (hard) and could be executed better. I am not a big fan of poached pear so I just had a small piece and washed down with the lemongrass tea I ordered. My dining partner had a latte and was impressed to know they brew Vittoria coffee from Australia.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was attentive and our glasses were filled with water most if not throughout the meal."

I got the set lunch, consisting of a salad/soup, main and dessert, for $38++. It was decent though not fantastic, main gripe though, was that the service was achingly slow. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Roasted pumpkin salad with Roquefort cheese: more pumpkin than rocket, and it was slathered in a heavy glaze. It was a bit heavy tasting, though the pumpkin went well with the cheese. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Grilled Norwegian salmon, chorizo and shaved fennel: presentation was good and the diced chorizo in beans was tasty. While the salmon skin was nice and crispy, the fish was slightly overcooked, tough and bland. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Sweet corn panna cotta, popcorn and truffle oil: slightly too firm but went nicely with the popcorn. The truffle undertone definitely added an interesting twist to the dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;I also heard good things about the hangar steak and prawn linguine that my friends opted for. <br&gt;<br&gt;Seems like the dinner items seem better than the lunch. Would love to return to try!"

I went with high hopes, bolstered by a slew of wonderful praises about the ingenuity of the food here, and the suspense was ever-more built by the fact that I had tried to brunch here more than a couple times (and something always happened to stop it*).<br&gt;<br&gt;*maybe it was the gourmand gods/ fate.<br&gt;<br&gt;it&amp;#39;s a rather awesome menu - large, interesting-sounding, and immensely enticing what with the descriptions. I massively love menus that tell me exactly what I&amp;#39;m going to eat - there&amp;#39;s something to be said for being held in suspense, but usually I like to order what I know I&amp;#39;d really want to eat.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve come to a point where small portions are appreciated only when expected - usually as part of a many-coursed meal - and I most certainly don&amp;#39;t expect it at brunch, which in itself is a hedonistic activity to ingest in a single meal what you would eat in two.<br&gt;<br&gt;the amount of food we got irked me to no end, especially since the quality of cooking and execution here was pretty great. it&amp;#39;s a pretty refined brunch, dishes are colorful, and the flavors are more than decent.<br&gt;<br&gt;an eggs cocotte was redolent with truffle and savoury mushrooms, and my halloumi dish was perked up with segments of peeled orange and a couple gren leaves.<br&gt;<br&gt;the partner was the only one that ordered a brunch big of braised pork cheeks, all soft and tender and delicious over a bed of soft silky truffled mash.<br&gt;<br&gt;but at twenty for my halloumi, I expect a little more than what would constitute only a small square of cheese and not even half an orange; and at thirty for the pork cheeks, perhaps some greens would have been welcome - not to mention quite a bit more mash or meat for a satisfying meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;the desserts were even more spectacular in execution, but didn&amp;#39;t buck the (lack of) size trend.<br&gt;<br&gt;this magnum-like bar of roquefort &amp;amp; honey ice cream coated in dark chocolate was a play on contrast between the rather blue ice cream and the not-too-sweet quality chocolate shell that shattered upon impact. I can&amp;#39;t much tolerate blue cheeses, and this was almost too strong for me to take, but the chocolate helped temper the pungency - and I found myself returning for more.<br&gt;<br&gt;the sticky toffee pudding was also darn delicious (and more sizable!): warm, moist pud sloping with its weight of delicious vanilla-speckled ice cream all drizzled with a delicious caramel.<br&gt;<br&gt;and also the peanut-butter-and-chocolate fondant, which came super dark (almost black, really) with roast banana slices on the side with another scoop of that fantastic icecream. it was warm and oozey and satisfyingly chocolatey.<br&gt;<br&gt;at the end of it, it was a fantastic meal flavor-wise. the chefs know what they&amp;#39;re doing in the kitchen, and flavors are contrasting and complementary, and the plating is both beautiful and very modern - but with three courses needed for any measure of satiety, and lunch-set portions what&amp;#39;s more, it&amp;#39;s a format of dining I think best left for more measured, formal meals than brunch.<br&gt;<br&gt;the meal left me disgruntled for sure - I understand restaurants need to be profitable, but there&amp;#39;s a fine line between sustainability and miserliness, and I think they might have stepped over it."

However, on a balance, we felt that this was not something mindblowing, and the waiters were rather inexperienced and mixed our still water with tap water however they were extremely apologetic about it. <br&gt;<br&gt;The nibblets were surprisingly good. As we waited for our friends to arrived, we tried some siders - pulled pork sandwich ($3.50 each) and was amazed by the texture, taste and quality of this mini burger. Salf of the sea ($8) - which is essentially fried fish skin and chips was pretty good too. <br&gt;<br&gt;What could be improved: The tartine of anchovy ($5 each) which was served on a piece of toast was a little too salty for our liking. Also, the crab cakes ($5 each) was a tad too spicy, and with such a small portion only just fitting a table spoon, it&amp;#39;s hardly satisfying. <br&gt;<br&gt;For starters, we had the Eel and Foie Gras ($26) which was one of my favourites of the night as it had a perfect mix of sweet and savoury. Dripped with delicious sweet sauce (Kabayaki sauce), the foie gras was wrapped in the eel and served with a piece of cut nashi pear and apple chips to top it off. Also on my favourite list is the steak tatare with soft quail egg ($18) in the middle that added a dash of flavour, but all in all it much tasted like nigiri. <br&gt;<br&gt;Worth a mention is their drinks. The Bloody Mary ($16) which was bloody good. It had the right amount of tobasco sauce, and was extremely refreshing. <br&gt;<br&gt;For mains, I had the crackling suckling pig ($68) which was a really small portion of meat served with some pickled cucumber marinated with honey and clove sauce for sides. Taste-wise, it is comparable to the suckling pigs you get in traditional Chinese restaurants like Imperial Treasure. However, portion-wise, it may not even be sufficient to fill the stomach of one person."

Do note though that they recently changed their menu, so some of the items previous Yelpers mentioned might no longer be available.<br&gt;<br&gt;Before I get into the food, I do like their sangrias, and don&amp;#39;t like their brunch menu, so really, best time to go? Dinner, or weekday lunches where they have great value sets.<br&gt;<br&gt;Okay. Ribs. Crispy lamb shortribs. OMG THESE ARE LIKE CRACK. They&amp;#39;re crispy, fall off the bone tender and flavourful, served with a yoghurt sauce and couscous. It&amp;#39;s just the bomb. I could work through a plate of these allll byyyyy myyyyyself. (Yes you&amp;#39;re supposed to imagine me sing that)<br&gt;<br&gt;The fish skin. Deep fried. Crisp. Light. Super appetizing. If you&amp;#39;ve never tried fried fish skin, you need to try it. Think pork cracking, but well. With a SLIGHT fish taste. I believe the dish was called salt of the sea or something like that.<br&gt;<br&gt;Beyond that? Many of the other dishes are pretty good, though those two are by far the absolute bests on the menu imho. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been with 3-4 different groups of people, so trust me when I say it&amp;#39;s generally a hit amongst most people I introduce to it.<br&gt;<br&gt;The biggest compliment I would pay it though, is that I personally think a meal at TDC is far more worth it than Bacchanalia. Similar concept, in the sharing dishes and modernity. Totally different pricing, totally different feels... but for me TDC is so much better value, and so much more likeable. #truestorybrah"

We had a hankering so decided to go to the Disgruntled Chef for dinner.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our server let us know the cuisine was modern European, tapas style and we were encouraged to share. So with that, we were off to explore and sample. Service was attentive and prompt, with helpful recommendations. The menu had nibbles, small plates and big plates. There were also sides but we were already mired in the decisions on the other 3, adding another category would only confuse us further. The waiter was helpful and suggested 5-6 small plates, or 1 big with some smalls. We ordered the following:<br&gt;<br&gt;Nibbles<br&gt;Salt of the Sea (Crispy fish skin &amp;amp; potato chips)<br&gt;I liked this dish a lot. Fish skin had the right crackle and got us off to a great start. Served with a vinegar sauce that enhanced the dish. Portions were substantial. Unfortunately, that couldn&amp;#39;t be said about the chips. They were so drenched in oil and were soft and chewy. A bag of Lay&amp;#39;s would&amp;#39;ve been fresher.<br&gt;<br&gt;Serrano Ham Bikini sandwiches with Brie<br&gt;I get the fancy, descriptive premium ingredients but when it looks smaller than my morning kaya toast, it just doesn&amp;#39;t cut it. In Catalan Spain, grilled cheese sandwiches are named bikinis. Sadly I was thinking of the diet sized portion of this dish so that one can fit into that piece of swimwear. It is so small, I don&amp;#39;t think it should be served even as a nibble. It was dark and I didn&amp;#39;t want to do any more injustice than needed by accompanying this review with dimly lit, poor shots of our meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;Small plates<br&gt;Crispy Lamb Shortribs with Chilli &amp;amp; Cumin<br&gt;This dish was lovely. Shortribs melted in your mouth. Lovely hint of spices. I almost didn&amp;#39;t want to share.<br&gt;<br&gt;Momotaro Tomatoes with Arugula &amp;amp; Miso-Burnt Butter Dressing<br&gt;4 slices of soft, over-ripened tomatoes. Maybe the vinegar from the crispy fish skin had overpowered our taste buds but the dressing didn&amp;#39;t come out. 4 slices?! It just barely qualifies as a whole tomato in my books.<br&gt;<br&gt;Big plate<br&gt;Fideua Negra (thin squid ink noodles with grilled squid, mussels &amp;amp; prawns)<br&gt;I found this dish almost.... there. You are served in the plate that the whole dish is baked in. The black squid ink noodles give a sweetness and very interesting taste. Lovely, but unfortunately what marred the dish were the very overcooked prawns that became pasty. Additionally for the price, the amount of seafood is underwhelming. <br&gt;<br&gt;Dessert<br&gt;Lemon Tart with Creme Fraiche &amp;amp; Blueberry Compote<br&gt;<br&gt;I wanted to like this place more. Cool name for a restaurant, vibe is upbeat, and it looked like a place to hangout in the alfresco area. The menu was tantalizing with lots of dishes that we wanted to try. Unfortunately the food and the dining experience we had overall was average. There were more misses that hits and we walked away feeling that for the price points they were charging, there are better options in this city. Huge potential, fails to deliver."

It was a 1.5 hour wait so we walked out and went to the next restaurant which was The Disgruntled Chef. We are all pleasantly surprised as the food was quite good. For the appetizer, I had the crispy lamb shortribs which had like a mediterranean rub. It was very tasty and cooked perfectly -- tender and juicy. For the main, I had the Roasted Miso Cod with mushrooms and baby spinach and it was fantastic. The flavor of the mushrooms and spinach did not over power the cod. The cod was perfectly cooked which was bursting with flavor. The winner was the dessert -- Roquefort Magnum --- roquefort and honey ice cream coated in dark chocolate. Don&amp;#39;t be deceived as it is looks like your grocery ice cream served in a bowl of ice. But take a bite and its a blue cheese flavored ice cream with the right balance of sweetness from the honey and dark chocolate. Perfect ending to a meal!<br&gt;The only down side are -- first, the menu is not so clear &amp;#34;Brunch Smalls&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Brunch Bigs&amp;#34;, who would have known it meant appetizers and mains? Second, the servers are not familiar with the menu so its quite frustrating if you want to know more about a dish. Lastly, the service is very slow. We didn&amp;#39;t notice it so much since I was dining with friends whom I have not seen so we were catching up. But we did notice that it took them 45mins to serve our dessert."

The Yuzu was strong and the jelly square bits on the top made it more chewy. According to my friend, it was refreshing.<br&gt;<br&gt;I also managed to take a spoonful of my friend&amp;#39;s matcha cake. There were too much cream in the middle that the taste of matcha was rather mild. It was soft and light. But for a friend with little tolerance of sweet desserts, she claimed that it was just right for her tastebuds.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ambience here is pretty cosy. Depending on the crowd, you can chose an indoor or outdoor (open space) seatings. I prefer the outdoor seating as you can see how they drip the coffees too and also good spot to observe people.<br&gt;<br&gt;Price wise, I think it is on the pricier end. But I did enjoy my dish that I got on the first visit. Will drop by to fulfill my curry and katsu cravings in the near future :)"

The dishes, unfortunately, are a hit or miss. Some are really very good, like the seafood tom yum risotto, the slipper lobster sandwich and the waffles, especially with the salted caramel ice cream. The tom yum flavor blended surprisingly well with the creaminess of the risotto, and the generous portion of lobster with mentaiko was decadent and tasty. Others, just lack a little bit of flavor or oomph. The bacon chowder and seafood broth is chock full of flavor, but the consistency of the chowder is  a little chalky, and the sous vide salmon in the broth is a little too briny for my liking. The matcha rice with beef was disappointing, with meagre serving of beef which was too dry despite being one of the more expensive items on the menu ($30.90). The prawn aglio olio and carbonara lack flavor as a whole, and the sweet corn risotto was a tad too sweet, which was the same issue with the chilli crab spaghetti. 4 stars if you are wise with what you pick, 2 stars if you are not."

Fortunately, it&amp;#39;s more than that.<br&gt;<br&gt;While vegetarian and vegan restaurants resort to preaching about how unhealthy, foolish and downright evil it is to eat any kind of animal product, Eat Me focuses on taste, freshness and balance. They don&amp;#39;t eradicate meat or animal protein from their menu. Instead, they use it in sensible portions, as a complement to fresh veggies, just as your nutritionist surely told you to do. Another good thing is they emphasise the use of local and organic products. Vegetables are always fresh, and if combined with a bit of egg, duck, fish or beef, there&amp;#39;s no way they can go wrong.<br&gt;<br&gt;Eat Me&amp;#39;s salads are delightful, and so are their very own cold-pressed juices. The make-your-own baked potatoes look tasty, but I have to try them yet. The star for me (and for many other customers, it seems)  is the Hulk Toast: a flavourful omelette served over a thick slice of wholegrain bread with heavenly avocado, cherry tomatoes and sesame seeds. I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of omelettes myself, but this is fantastically well done. It has become my favourite local breakfast. Coffee is provided by the famous Sarnies. It&amp;#39;s not the best, but it&amp;#39;s certainly superior than what can be found at UE Square.<br&gt;<br&gt;Among the overpriced bars, franchise coffee shops and fancy places around UE Square, Eat Me shines for their healthy, honest, unpretentious and appetising food. It is truly refreshing to have a local restaurant that serves healthy food that sells itself on taste, with no need for preaching. I&amp;#39;m a big fan already.<br&gt;<br&gt;Curious fact: they managed to get rid of the burnt fat smell that loomed in the kopitiam that was there before. That alone is a reason to admire them."

Perfect for after working out. <br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been here twice now and have tried the Daffy Duck and Big Miss steak, I&amp;#39;m definitely coming to try everything.<br&gt;The place also served breakfast! I have yet to try but they look yummy.<br&gt;Oh and they have also just started putting cold press juices on the menu. I had the &amp;#34;coconut, green apple, spinach and cucumber&amp;#34; juice...and yes it tastes even better than it sounds! <br&gt;Can&amp;#39;t wait to come back to this place!"

Okay, I do have to say that the staff were pretty good, but when I looked at the menu there really wasn&amp;#39;t anything all that appealing. The place was pretty small, so all of the seats were outside, and while their coffee was okay, it wasn&amp;#39;t the best.

I saw Kith and recalled that I had been at their other location by Dhoby Ghaut and did not find it horrible so I was up for giving it a shot (and to be honest at this point I would probably even have given McDonalds a chance). Kith has a pretty relaxed setting at a corner of a house with some shade but it does not really have any seats inside so even if it is shaded it is still fairly warm.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had some pretty decent pasta with a pretty good flat white while S went for a toastie and a freshly pressed juice. Neither of these were anything special but more what one can expect and prices are a bit higher than I would like to pay but then it is Robertson Quay after all so perhaps to be expected. I have since been a few more times and they are in a sense reliable, there has so far never been anything amazing nor anything really disappointing. It can tend to get a bit too noisy around as many families with children appear to like to come here and at least when I have been there it has been the type of people who do not feel like telling their kids to behave and take it easy so if that disturbs you it may not be the best place."

Well I do &amp;#39;cos I&amp;#39;m having lunch at kith&amp;#39;s cafe. <br&gt;<br&gt;A little Monday pick-me-up lunch of Spaghetti Meatballs and Flat White makes my Monday that much sweeter. <br&gt;<br&gt;My first time here, I was abit disappointed that the place was a bit small (no seating inside) but managed to get a seat outside, facing the river. However, since it was a Monday, there wasn&amp;#39;t much crowd save for the odd Caucasian couple with kids, Caucasian yuppies and a few passer-bys getting some takeaway coffee. The view was good - luckily the sky was overcast and the weather was cool; I can&amp;#39;t imagine what it would be like if it is a hot sunny day!  <br&gt;<br&gt;Food was ok but coffee gets my nod of approval! I drank one cup and got another one to take back to the office. <br&gt;<br&gt;Will definitely drop by again - but not on weekends!"

Love their white bread in the big brek always nicely toasted and love the homely strawberry jam - it really looks like someone spent all day cooking it on the hearth.<br&gt;<br&gt;Free wifi - always a nice bonus.<br&gt;<br&gt;Prices for the big brek and coffee are attractive.

As for the omu rice, the omelette was fluffy and soft and proved satisfying for my friend. The clam chowder soup had average consistency but flavour wise, it was still good.<br&gt;<br&gt;A nice spot to chill in the city and the fact that it is little known (for now) makes it the perfect place for a catch up with friends or to read the day away."

It is very conducive to sit and chat with friends  over coffee and desserts. My friend had coffee which came with a tiny portion of milk that was surprisingly enough to enrich the taste. Refilling another cup costs half the price of the first cup. A few of us shared the pancake soufflé with maple syrup and vanilla softee. Preparation took 20 minutes which was indicated in the menu. While the dish was fluffy and tasty, it felt more like a regular pancake instead of having much resemblance to soufflé so next time I would rather order a proper soufflé."

I have been to Crossroads many many years ago, it looked different then. I am sure it has gone through renovations and upgrade since. If anyone is worried the café would be too hot for comfort, there is no need to fear. There were huge ceiling fans and in fact it was really comfortable dining there. Trust me on that since I am always so scared of places which have no air conditioning in Singapore. <br&gt;<br&gt;FOOD 5/5<br&gt;<br&gt;Char Kway Teow - This is a local dish which comprised of flat wide noodles with eggs, vegetables, fish cake, huge prawns and squids. I know the locals may cry foul with anyone eating a local street food at a 5 star hotel with 5 star pricing. I beg to differ. The portion of my Char Kway Teow was huge, the ingredients were fresh and the café was generous with the prawns. Mmmmm... Yummy!<br&gt;<br&gt;Lychee Iced Tea - I never have a Lychee Iced Tea. Very refreshing!! I really like it :) <br&gt;<br&gt;AMBIENCE 5/5<br&gt;<br&gt;Despite the café not being enclosed, it was not warm. There were huge ceiling fans mounted and it was rather breezy siting under the fan. It was like me sitting in a resort restaurant except we were in the middle of the bustling Orchard Road area. <br&gt;<br&gt;This is probably the best café in Orchard area for people watching. I have no interest in people watch, I only like to look at the food I am eating, lol!!<br&gt;<br&gt;SERVICE 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;The staffs were nice. Service was what I expected from a 5 star hotel like Marriott. Took a while to holler down a staff to get my check at the end of lunch though. Also, the bread should come before the meal and not together. Hence, the one star off. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, Crossroads is a great place for a nice, relaxing lunch. Bonus for people who like to people watch."

S$32++ was the price - still not cheap but better than the S$50++ it would have cost by sitting inside. <br&gt;<br&gt;Let me start with the positive. The selection is absolutely amazing. If you can&amp;#39;t find anything to eat, then we need to have a different discussion. Their cappuccinos are from Illy - their beans are of a high standard and drinking coffee becomes an instant pleasure. <br&gt;<br&gt;As for the issues. Everything has sugar in it and is made extra sweet (roti prata, yoghurt, bircher müsli, etc.) - aspartame-laced, perhaps. Not the best for you or your body. In addition, they use genetically modified (GM) oils to cook their dishes. When their omelette Chef started taking the canola oil can to spray on my eggs, I almost lost it. <br&gt;<br&gt;I tend to (try and) reeducate people on the risks of these GM foods, yet the Chef tried to convince me that it was indeed healthy (does that mean everything is booked with Canola Oil??). The scenario turned somewhat comical when the caucasian Chef - overhearing our conversation - sprinted over to the station and immediately confirmed that the dish could of course be made just as I requested. <br&gt;<br&gt;So I am happy to report that they understand the risks but I guess in order to maximize their contribution margins and minimize food cost, they look the other way. If you don&amp;#39;t care for your health for at least one day a week, eat here!"

It has the feel of an old canteen, reminding me of those desperately-trying-to-look-old, kitsch cantinas so popular in Mexico City, with tiled floors, posters on the walls and vintage marble tables, a bit crammed on the inside.

However, the environment ultimately works and the place feels strangely authentic and inviting.<br&gt;<br&gt;The first interesting thing are the two different menus: East Asian and North Indian. Both of them contained snippets of information, kind of &amp;#34;explaining&amp;#34; the dishes. We were told to choose what kind of menu we wanted to have, so we chose the Indian menu (I&amp;#39;m always keen on Indian food). We had a very good, fragrant and spicy fish curry. Then I tried the masala chicken liver, which was spectacular. It was rich in flavour, while at the same time full of subtle surprises. I could say food tasted almost home-cooked, there was a special level of care involved. There&amp;#39;s no way I couldn&amp;#39;t love that.<br&gt;<br&gt;It must be hard to keep the balance of style and substance in a restaurant. My first impression of The Tiong Bahru Club was that of a place favouring the former. It is always good to be proven wrong. Here, style is no more than the background to a sense-appealing meal. I will surely come back."

I know.. What&amp;#39;s new right? <br&gt;Located at the corner of Eng Hoon St. And Seng Poh road, we&amp;#39;ve seen this place transform from an old coffee shop (our favourite Loo&amp;#39;s Hainanese curry rice used to be here) transform into this upmarket eatery. <br&gt;<br&gt;At first glance, this place looked like just another upmarket, snooty diner, filled with expats, yuppies and a certain breed of Singaporean females that have a certain preference for guys I should not name. <br&gt;<br&gt;Anyway... What got us trying this place was the nostalgic feel and the fact that it did not serve the usual eggs Benedict, breakfast sets, waffles or pancakes, and they certainly didn&amp;#39;t promote themselves as the next big coffee joint with magical beans from the bottom of the Amazon River. <br&gt;Instead, what this place specializes in is... Indian food and chai!! Surprise surprise! <br&gt;<br&gt;Well.. I guess it made sense considering that the Brits and the Indians / Sikhs have long had a history together. <br&gt;Anyway... I&amp;#39;m a sucker for indian food so this place, despite how hard I tried to say no, still got the better of me. <br&gt;<br&gt;They have 2 sets of menus here, an Asian menu, with fried rice and soto Ayam and an Indian menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;We decided to go for a Murgh Dum Briyani, my favourite Palek Paneer,a Masala Chicken Liver and what better way to wash down our food than with a nice pot of Himalayan Sikkih tea.<br&gt;<br&gt;First came the Briyani. A good sharing portion that could easily feed 2-3 pax. The rice was wonderfully fragrant with the spices and flavours beautifully infused in and the chicken, despite being the breast, was tender and oh-so-flavourful. So good in fact that it just might be one of the best Briyani&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ve had in a while. <br&gt;<br&gt;Next was the Masala Chicken liver. Now this dish was the star of our lunch. It is literally to die for! The liver was nice and tender and the sauce, with all its onions and spices was amazing. Every bite was a dream and this dish is enough to bring us back for more. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally the Paneer, my personal favourite. The sauce was nice and smooth without the spinach being over powering while the cheese was smooth and &amp;#34;bouncy&amp;#34;. Only thing it could do with was a little more salt, otherwise it was another very good dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;The tea itself was nice and fragrant and proof that chaitime, the guys behind this restaurant, know their teas. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, it was s wonderful experience and the only reason this place didn&amp;#39;t get a 5 is down to a few simple factors. <br&gt;A) indoor searing was a little tight, with most 4 pax tables nearly touching each other and effectively becoming a 3 top. <br&gt;B) service was slow as well, with the 2 waiters clearly being inexperienced and frankly a little lost most of the time. <br&gt;C) food did take a little longer than it should, with U.S. almost finishing our Briyani by the time the paneer came. <br&gt;D) the prices. A little on the strap side at around $20-$25 per pax for an Indian meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I love how they kept some of the coffee shop&amp;#39;s elements while updating it, leaving a nice nostalgic feel, down to the music choice. <br&gt;<br&gt;We&amp;#39;ll definitely be back for more!"

The food was actually pretty good - the Indian food only. We had chicken not the spicy one and it was juicy and citrusy and delicious. Also had the Dahl and the baigan bartha and naan and plain rice and one more thing. But it was all tasty and very spicy but good. The service was meh. I asked for ginger ale and they said no we don&amp;#39;t have it. I pointed out on the menu where it was listed. Was advised they don&amp;#39;t have it anymore. Asked what on this list they had. They have juice and coke. There were five more things listed. Ok I&amp;#39;ll just have water. Have to flag them down if you want anything so they don&amp;#39;t check back.

There was wine on the table but noone knew how much it cost.<br&gt;The food we had was OK but nothing to rave about. we only got a few entrees and this was only because my husband ordered them earlier as he had arrived 1/2 hour before  us.

Not the easiest place to find as I had to use the goggle map to find its exact location. Located at Shaw Tower along Beach Road, its on the ground flour, just walk all the way in and you find it. Interior of this ice cream place looks ordinary and you would think this is just a normal ice cream place but wait till you try the flavours. I was amazed with some of the unique flavours such as the Granny&amp;#39;s favourite and the Salted Egg Yolk flavours, you can&amp;#39;t get this anywhere else at least to me. <br&gt;<br&gt;There are so many other flavours to try, but having only one stomach, I got to take it easy. So coming back here is definitely in my agenda."

It may be easy to dump thimbles of yuzu syrup into the ice cream machine but it&amp;#39;s difficult to produce ice cream of the right sweetness and texture. Flavors include grannys favorite, salted caramel cheesecake, berries and split, pi pa gao, and of course usuals like chocolate, strawberry. <br&gt;<br&gt;I highly recommend the yuzu flavor!! It&amp;#39;s sweet, light and refreshing. We also tried a mix of chocolate and grannys favorite (a mix of chocolate, malt, marshmallows, i think?), and spent awhile chilling in the spacious interior. There&amp;#39;re many tables and it reminds me of those student haunts at Upper Thomson.

Tom the owner was happy to suggest numerous flavours and provide generous taste testers to help with the decision process. Tom shed some light on how he and his team make the icecream and the creative process in inventing new and exciting flavours. My friend decided on the chocolate sorbet which was like eating pure cocoa chocolate. It is not for a subtle palette as it is made without dairy making it very strong and rich. Luckily I was more than happy to finish of the rest when my friend had enough of the rich flavours.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had the much raved about salted egg yolk icecream. It was interesting to say the least. It had a floury taste that coated my mouth, followed by the sweetness and creaminess of the egg yolk complimenting the saltiness.  The salted egg yolk is definitely an experience and one that I could happily relive. <br&gt;<br&gt;After doing a bit more searching, I found out that they offer icecream lessons, normally on a Sunday.

Joy - because they always have a great new flavor to try, woe - because after multiple ice cream pig-out sessions, I could hardly squeeze into my office shirts anymore. <br&gt;<br&gt;The first defining trait of this local-grown parlour is the awesome variety they have. Even their traditional staples are whacky in their own way. I&amp;#39;ve always enjoyed the chocolate stout, Granny&amp;#39;s favourite (a mix of banana and chocolate), and salted egg yolk ice cream. On my last visit, I had their Breakfast flavor - a delicious mix of kaya and banana toffee. If you want to turn on the sinful factor, mix two flavors in milkshake form. The day I tried their Hazelnut and Rum &amp;amp; Raisin I was torn between a world of bliss, and the worry that I&amp;#39;d suffer from cardiac arrest. <br&gt;<br&gt;The price hardly does the quality justice. At $3.50 for a small scoop of 2 flavors, you can&amp;#39;t get any better. The sheer range of the selection will make you want to come back, and bring all your friends."

It created quite a hoo-ha when we tried it among ourselves. General consensus was it is very good. There is this grainy taste much like having real salted egg, but cushioned with the sweet icy taste of frozen milk.<br&gt;<br&gt;Other flavors which I like include the ones with the magic dust that sizzles and pops in your mouth and their salted caramel. I think most of their flavors are excellent so it really is up to personal choice. <br&gt;<br&gt;It can get really noisy and crowded on weekends though so be prepared for it. Not an ideal place for chit chats, definitely. Just enjoy your cup of goodness and go."

Plus, my family recently adopted a dog, Pika, so I thought it would be great to socialize him with some of his furry friends. Sun Ray is one of the few pet friendly cafes in Singapore. They allow you take the leash off your pooch on the premise provided you clean up after it. Pooch are allowed on chairs and they even have a special dog menu :) <br&gt;<br&gt;So Pika and I headed there on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Initially, I was just going to order a cup of coffee and read on my kindle while Pika did his social rounds but I never got around to it. Instead I spent my time chatting with other dog lovers and joined them in the ritual of fawning and fussing over our pets. Pika picked out a BFF among 4 or 5 other dogs. She was a beautiful white poodle-maltese named Yumi and they played non-stop for 2 hours straight chasing each all over the restaurant. 0.0 In the end, I decided to have dinner there too since I could not bear to tear him away from his new found best friend. I decided to order a eggs benny. The eggs benny was served with a delicious cone instead of bread. It was the best part of the dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;A lesser known fact is that Sun Ray makes really really really good coffee. Think Nylon coffee good. Their barista Charmaine was kind enough to chat with me on different types of coffee and show me the equipment they used to make it. This is what I recalled from our conversation, <br&gt;<br&gt;1. The French pressed method - gives a sweeter taste to the brew. <br&gt;<br&gt;2. The Siphon method - gives the coffee a clearer appearance.<br&gt;<br&gt;3. The Pour over method - gives it a stronger and richer taste.<br&gt;<br&gt;*varies accordingly with the beans used, of course :) <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered a flat white with soya milk. They used the brand Pacific. My first time trying it but it was as good as &amp;#34;boysoy&amp;#34; (not sure the exact spelling of this brand even though I had it multiple times). Overall, their coffee blew me away. I was not expecting such a high standard of coffee for a pet cafe? It totally beats The Coffee Daily (just next door). Sun Ray takes their coffee seriously and I&amp;#39;ll definitely be back for more! I know Pika cannot wait to go back too :) <br&gt;<br&gt;PS: Charmaine cordially invites our coffee expert &amp;amp; beloved CM to try her brews!!! She&amp;#39;s always excited to meet a fellow barista!"

Coffee appreciation courses are conducted here now and you can enjoy various coffee brewed using different techniques such as syphon, cold-brew, French press, and own specialty drip coffee. The folks even have their  own custom-roasted blend, called the Brighton blend.<br&gt; <br&gt;Needless to say, i got really high after sampling the various coffees. I quite enjoyed the latte and the iced mocha wasn&amp;#39;t too shady as well. The cold brew will send your brain and heart into overdrive. Try it at your own risk! Now if only they serve better desserts to go with my coffee. After all, a good cafe has to have the entire package and that includes good sweets to accompany the coffee. <br&gt;<br&gt;The homemade scones ($3), which were promised to be crusty and buttery, fell terribly short of my expectation. This is not a scone. It&amp;#39;s a cross between a bun and a really soft tart. I finished half the chocolate scone because i wanted to eat the chocolate chips. The blueberry and strawberry (or was it raspberry) ones reminded me of the Arnott&amp;#39;s tartlets in terms of flavor. The crust was not even as crisp as Artnott&amp;#39;s. Meh. <br&gt;<br&gt;I shall not even discuss the cupcakes ($3). Go figure. The Tiramisu ($6.50) weren&amp;#39;t that bad after they defrosted. I believe SRC is working on adding more coffee to that recipe after our feedback. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Oven-Baked Escargots ($8.90 half-dozen | $15.90 one dozen) were well flavored with the garlic and parsley butter. They are typically served in the escargot pot but this was for our tasting purposes. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Wild Mushroom Soup ($7.90) was made fresh and came served with the perfumed truffle oil. I love the thick, creamy and smooth texture and intense flavor of this one. <br&gt;<br&gt;My favorite dish was the Carbonara ($12.90). This is the dish that i&amp;#39;ll come back to SRC for (since it&amp;#39;s in da hood). I&amp;#39;m glad that this pasta isn&amp;#39;t swimming in sauce. This was pretty salty but i love that each mouthful had the smoky meat flavor of the bacon and each strand was nicely coated with sticky cream, raw egg yolk and cheese. Too good... <br&gt;<br&gt;J enjoyed the Cumin Crusted Lamb Rack ($23.90) which was served with ratatouille and rosemary sauce. The meat was tender and didn&amp;#39;t have that gamey taste. The Grilled Strip Loin ($23.90) served with potato gratin and the Yorkshire Pork Rack ($23.90) with apple cider sauce both paled in comparison. Both meats were overdone and dry and we simply gave up after 2 bites (you can&amp;#39;t say that we didn&amp;#39;t give them a second chance). <br&gt;<br&gt;Hits and misses at Sun Ray Cafe. I would say go for their coffee and tiramisu. The carbonara and lamb rack are worth dropping by for as well. The atmosphere is pretty AJ after their reno though. i wonder why.. Anyway, special treat for my readers on my blog."

We picked Bob&amp;#39;s because he wanted live music, and I wasn&amp;#39;t too sure about where to get live music in Singapore. Another plus was that it was outdoors.The Havana Night event only happens on Fridays, and it&amp;#39;s still happening. We went last October, during the haze season, and lucked out because not many people wanted to be outdoors even though the weather was fine the day of. When you&amp;#39;re at Bob&amp;#39;s, you really want to be outdoors where the daybeds are. It was night, so we couldn&amp;#39;t see much. But the sea breeze was really nice. There were no peacocks the night we went, and I think it&amp;#39;s more sanitary that way.<br&gt;<br&gt;While Bob&amp;#39;s is mainly a bar, they serve food too. For Havana Night, they hire a chef to BBQ outdoors, so you smell your food as it is being prepared. We ordered a couple of the Havana Night platter for two, and it served everything on the BBQ menu. My dad particularly liked the lamb. The shrimp with mango salsa was really good too. We also ordered appetizers from the menu -- I particularly liked the pizza. I don&amp;#39;t recommend their dessert though.<br&gt;<br&gt;For drinks, we ordered and shared a selection of cocktails. If you&amp;#39;re uncertain, they have a set of 3 glasses of any cocktail as a sampler. Some of the cocktails incorporate Singaporean flavors, like gula melaka. For the more traditional, you can just order a shot of whisky.<br&gt;<br&gt;As for the live music, it was a trio of men, a singer with guitar, keyboards and drums. They sing in Spanish, and it was a mix of classic and contemporary songs. Definitely crowd pleasers. If you&amp;#39;re into Latin dancing, they will play requests too, and the singer is happy to teach the basic steps. There is plenty of dancing space.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now being situated in the Capella hotel, home to $1000-a-night rooms, you may be a little daunted by the idea of coming to Bob&amp;#39;s. For our party of 7, we ended up spending about $400, which was decent. We had a drink each, but we didn&amp;#39;t drink excessively.<br&gt;<br&gt;Bob&amp;#39;s is a little hard to reach, so you&amp;#39;re going to have to cab in and out. But the whole experience was magical, kind of like being transported to a whole new world. My dad had a lot of fun, and he can&amp;#39;t wait to go back again. Yes, it&amp;#39;s surprisingly family friendly (we&amp;#39;re all grown ups, but a couple of older people won&amp;#39;t stand out, unlike at some other hipper joints.)"

I&amp;#39;ve tried their pastas in the past, and although they&amp;#39;re delicious, I found them a bit small portion-wise. I decided to try their panini and now I&amp;#39;m in love.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the veggie Morrocan, which comprises of portabello mushrooms, eggplant, and zucchini along with some cheese and other spices. It had beautiful grill marks and they used thin, flat bread. It was pricy at $14, but at least I felt full afterwards!<br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re dining with a friend, I do recommend splitting one of the pizzas. The all day breakfast one looks hangover worthy as it has 2 fried eggs on top, and judging from the rest of my colleagues&amp;#39; orders, anything with meat looks appetizing.<br&gt;<br&gt;They also offer baked goods and ice cream. I won&amp;#39;t lie; I indulged myself by having a scoop of their apple crumble ice cream. It was amazing and worth $6 plus the Jillian Michaels kickboxing exercise video I had to suffer through after I got home from work!<br&gt;<br&gt;The ambiance here is top notch. Dark, marble interiors surrounded by affordable wine bottles that tempt you to do a boozy lunch. What&amp;#39;s not to love? Well, in the past, this used to be a takeaway spot, but now they have seating available.... Yet they still want to emphasize their takeaway roots by serving everything in takeaway containers. I think this just generates more excessive waste if you plan on eating in. Just invest in some real plates and silverware already, you guys can obviously afford it!"

(Giving credit where credit is due) <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s located near my workplace (10 minutes at a moderate walking pace) and I&amp;#39;ve been making trips here for spontaneous dinners after work, or when I have an hour or so to burn.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried the garlic flatbread, the TRUFFLE garlic flatbread, the fennel sausage pizza, the caesar salad, the chicken rossa penne and 2 flavors of ice cream (hazelnut and some other one that I can&amp;#39;t remember offhand).<br&gt;<br&gt;The garlic flatbread comes in thin triangular slices, almost like a thin-crust pizza, and is very very garlicky and satisfying, though the portion is huge for one. Even with 2 we were stuffed. Best shared amongst a group of 4 (there are 8 slices). The truffle version was good but I didn&amp;#39;t think it was worth the additional $4.<br&gt;<br&gt;The pizza was unique and the kurobuta pork and fennel sausages complemented each other nicely. I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of tomatoes and the tomato was strong in this one. I felt that the crust, while thin, could be less dense and doughy. Pizzeria Mozza is still my preferred place when it comes to pizzas in general, but this is a worthy competitor.<br&gt;<br&gt;The chicken rossa penne was ok, again the tomato was strong in this one. Al dente penne is served in a tomato-cream sauce with what I thought was a pile of melted cheese on the top (but the menu mentions spinach, chicken and mushrooms). They serve their stuff in takeaway boxes, with the pasta separate from the dressing, so you have to pour in the sauce yourself. The pasta itself was nicely cooked but this dish failed to impress. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their ice cream is $6, a tad pricey but the first time I was there, I was given two huge scoops (I smiled nicely). It was delicious, smooth and creamy with the distinct taste of hazelnut. The second time was also good but not as wonderful as the first (I suspect this is why I can&amp;#39;t remember what I ate).<br&gt;<br&gt;Oh and it says &amp;#34;takeaway&amp;#34; everywhere but there are actually enough seats for about 15 people inside.

Which is all well and good - a lot of cafes does that. Menu is kinda basic, don&amp;#39;t expect a lot to choose from. And after paying, was told that I had to collect my food as well. Okieeeeee... Bear in mind the kind of prices you are paying .... <br&gt;<br&gt;Order pizza, a salad, a cuppa coffee and a juice. When I went to collect the food, all were in paper boxes.... But ok, they did say take away only. The salad came in the box and we were suppose to share so I went to ask for another box. I was told that they don&amp;#39;t give any more boxes.  was the expression on my face. Went to take two paper cups to use as container to share out the salad. <br&gt;<br&gt;Not the most environmentally friendly kinda place. And for the a-bit-above-average-cafe-prices that you are paying, I think it&amp;#39;s only right to expect a wee bit more. <br&gt;<br&gt;That said, if you are willing to pay that price for take away only, you are in luck, because the food is decent.

Despite also being a test kitchen for PS Cafe, it is beautifully decorated with chrome, faux brick and black wood paneling. The menu is written on the chalkboard and has a wall full of wine to go along with the pizzas. <br&gt;<br&gt;The selection is simple. Purely pizza and 1 salad option. As it is not a full fledged cafe or restaurant, they are not allowed to serve food on plates and cups etc. The pizza came in a box and drinks are in a take-away plastic or paper cups. Plastic cutlery and napkins are provided if you wish to have a quick meal on the premises. But seriously, the place is not meant dining in. If you want to eat there, it will be better to either come at non peak (read lunch or dinner hours). It is definitely a very nice place to wait for your pizza to be ready and have a drink or so while waiting. <br&gt;<br&gt;There is a small selection of gigantic muffins for sale too. They look temptingly delicious. <br&gt;<br&gt;The four cheese porcini was very good, just out of the oven and made with fresh ingredients. The salad with blueberries, pine nuts, wolfberries, sunflower seeds etc was equally to die for. I love the freshness of the food. I am not sure if the pizza will hold up well if you need to travel for long as the steam will usually make pizza a bit soggy after a while. <br&gt;<br&gt;But this is a great find for fantastic pizza for those living in the Tiong Bahru area."

In general the staff are also helpful.<br&gt;<br&gt;They also have a nice (and by Singapore standards probably very nice) wine selection at prices that are not that bad.

OK, we really should&amp;#39;ve gone looking for a restaurant that was more Singaporean (is that a word?) but instead we landed here. The first thing we stopped at was the cute store, loaded with fun DC super heroes stuff. Then we decided we were hungry. There was a small wait and you had to pay for water (which was weird, since it was the first time we had to pay for water since we landed a week earlier). <br&gt;<br&gt;Still, loved the DC integrations into all the food and drink items. The alcoholic drink items tended to land on the sweet side which made it difficult to drink. Still, the drinks were pretty stiff anyway. Got my friend to drink two and he was VERY happy. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Green Lantern burger, complete with the symbol on the bun. It had chicken with chunks of shrimp and crab meat sauce all over it. UGHHH it was great. The portion was so large that I had to take most of it home. We also got complimentary chips &amp;amp; salsa since we had to wait long (although....with the drinks, we didn&amp;#39;t think we waited long at all). Service was pretty great and there is tons of stuff to buy and fill your Super Hero needs.<br&gt;<br&gt;Clearly, there are cheaper places to eat but this place is a fun one. And you can take a picture with Wonder Woman."

The whole purpose of those cafes are the concept and the deco. When I stopped to take a photo before I was seated, my Friend noticed that the waitress let out a sigh of impatience. It&amp;#39;s 615 on a weekday and the place only had a few tables taken - there were plenty of empty seats. <br&gt;<br&gt;Sat down ordered 2 drinks off the menu and a glass of ice water. For food, two cakes and one portion of truffle fries. After 5 mins, was told that two cakes are not available. Friend asked to see the menu and waiter said ok, but never came back.<br&gt;<br&gt;Two strawberry coolers came when we just ordered one. Fries came. At least the fries were good, hence the single star for this place. <br&gt;<br&gt;After a while, we reminded the waitress of our order of a drink and water which has not come. The waitress looked at me as if I was stupid and said - we don&amp;#39;t serve ice water here.<br&gt;<br&gt;Seriously now... <br&gt;<br&gt;So I just ordered mineral water with ice.... But after 5 mins or so, a glass of ice water came. Friend was a bit frighten to drink the unidentified looking water.... <br&gt;<br&gt;Have not paid yet. Typing this here and hopefully the paying experience itself won&amp;#39;t require me to update this already nasty review even more...."

I was asking for suggestions and nothing. Anyways I ordered a burger for dinner that was pretty good. My biggest disappointment was with dessert. I asked for one of the desserts and the server told me that I had to walk over to the bakery next door to see if they had it? Anyways at some point a manager came over and cleared it all up.

The food prices were high and the excitement factor was not there. I must say that we are not particularly superhero fans. We just like themed restaurants.
