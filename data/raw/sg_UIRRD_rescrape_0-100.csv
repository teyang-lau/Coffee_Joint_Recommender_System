We took a cab here from Chinatown because we were not sure where it was, but it&amp;#39;s actually a short walk from a subway station, so take the subway to save on transportation expenses. <br&gt; <br&gt;We had the Hagrid&amp;#39;s Afternoon Tea and I am so glad we ordered it!  Everything on the menu was delicious. I have to admit that I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if the items would look exactly like it was on the menu because there are those places where the pictures in the menu are better then what you get and then there are those places where the pictures in the menu don&amp;#39;t do them justice. Well, these pictures represented exactly what we received! <br&gt;<br&gt;This is a perfect place for any &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; fan. Yes I say true because I have read reviews on here where they say that their friend didn&amp;#39;t realize it was a HP café. How are you a true fan and not notice this? Seriously!!!! From the menu, to the decorations, to the photo area, it all screams Harry Potter!!!!!  <br&gt;<br&gt;If you want to order the Hagrid&amp;#39;s Afternoon Tea, keep in mind that it starts at 2pm and it&amp;#39;s in limited quantities. Also, come with an appetite as it is a lot of food for 2 people. At least I think it&amp;#39;s a lot of food. My husband had the seafood menu items, and he said they tasted really good. I had the non-seafood menu items and it was so delicious! All the desserts were amazing! Though I did order some coffee to counteract the sweetness of the desserts. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, a must for any HP fan that is visiting Singapore!"

The food was absolutely delicious. My friends got breakfast food that they really enjoyed (side note: I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they put truffle oil in their eggs, so just keep that in mind in case you don&amp;#39;t like truffle), while I got pasta with chicken and pesto. I was a little dismayed that they put lemon in it, as I personally do not like lemon at all, but it was still very good. The sauce was so creamy, and the plating was beautiful, as it was for the other meals. We also had a piece of chocolate cake that was amazing - it was rich, decadent, and moist. I split the cake with a friend, which was definitely a good idea because the food is quite filling here. One of my friends ordered Mr Lich&amp;#39;s Flaming Brew, which was an alcoholic drink that they light on fire by sprinkling what I think was cinnamon onto it. It was definitely a cool sight, though I&amp;#39;m not sure how it tasted. I&amp;#39;m not really one to go all out with themes like this, but my friends convinced me to wear the robes they had for each of the houses in Harry Potter, and it ended up being a fun touch. Overall had a great time and would definitely recommend for a weekend brunch spot."

I remember while waiting for our food and drinks, my friends and I had battles with the wands haha. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the famous drink that lights up when sprinkled with cinnamon. It was the coolest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever done. It was particularly of course my favorite part in the restaurant. The drink itself was good and let me tell you that it&amp;#39;s an alcoholic drink. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered a lot of desserts since we ate from one of the hawk centers there. <br&gt;The food we got was why this place is only a three stars for me. <br&gt;<br&gt;I took out two because it was just not very good. I had so much expectations. I wanted it to be as magical in my mouth with the expensive price point. For one dish it was like $15-16 and so I was hoping it would be worth it. But it&amp;#39;s not. <br&gt;<br&gt;This restaurant just needs better food and more people will flock here especially since it&amp;#39;s Harry Potter, the business owners need to use that to their advantage and give their customers a more deserving magical and whimsical experience."

Had I come in the daytime, I think the natural lighting would have made for some amazing pictures. <br&gt;<br&gt;We got the butterscotch ale, and though I&amp;#39;ve never been to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, my friend who has said it tasted JUST like the butterbeer you can find there. It was delicious. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was surprisingly good for a theme cafe. We got the confit chicken with pesto spaghetti and the pesto mayo pork ribs. Both were really well cooked, not too much pesto on either but enough to give you a could flavor. The pork ribs were super tender and the sides that came with it were delicious, very American-style like mashed potatoes and sweet corn. I loved it and that&amp;#39;s coming from an American mashed potato addict. <br&gt;<br&gt;The witch&amp;#39;s brew, although I didn&amp;#39;t try it, seems like it&amp;#39;s something you can&amp;#39;t miss here.

Well I must say that Instagram has been most helpful in keeping me updated with the prettiest cafés on the block and that kinda led me to One Man Coffee, a hole in the wall that shares their shop front with Crust gourmet Pizza Bar along Upper Thomson Road. <br&gt;<br&gt;Sip on the Melbournian Axil Coffee Roaster beans pulled by Sarah Jane (formerly from Immigrants) or E-gene (who pulled his way around MEL). Coffee is little acidic with medium finish. My latte wasn&amp;#39;t quite full bodied or milky though. While it&amp;#39;s not quite my style, it was sufficient in packing a punch to last me through my afternoon meeting. Coffee is priced between $3 to $6.50. <br&gt;<br&gt;OMC also stocks B.A.O&amp;#39;s pastries. I simply love Christophe&amp;#39;s croissants, well the French makes the best croissants! The Chocolate pain is also amazing. Get them to heat it up for that crispy flakiness. Better still, have them with honey ham and melted cheese ($6). Cakes are also available and I was seduced by a Salted Caramel Banana Cake.<br&gt;<br&gt;For something a little more than sweets, OMC does all-day-breakfast with a lean but mean menu, all of which come out of a pizza oven! Talk about easy to make but delicious food here! <br&gt;<br&gt;Love the description of the Gashouse Egg aka Toad in hole aka Egg-in-the-bread-with-the-hole-in-the-middle ($10). It&amp;#39;s more of a snack I feel. I really do have a monster appetite for breakfast food. The dish is really simple, they really do just make a hole in the fluffy brioche, crack an egg in, top with cheese and into the oven it goes. Almost a croque madame.<br&gt;<br&gt;Really there&amp;#39;s no need to be fancy for brekkie when the ingredients are good (hello ooooozy yolk). What&amp;#39;s special is that bacon jam which is smoky, meaty and sweet. I could do with a thick layer of that in the toast anytime. Satisfying flavors, a little dry on the edges, not so satisfying portion but that helps save space for other food. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Broiche French Toast ($10) is another popular item and it looked freaking amazing with the homemade berry compote, candied walnuts and fresh cream. Of course the dust of sugary white completes the instagram worthy picture. <br&gt;<br&gt;OMC is a great alternative to the super packed Habitat Coffee which I failed to visit TWICE! Well I guess I&amp;#39;ll just have to explore the rest of the Thomson cafés until Habitat becomes less crowded. Anyhoo, great vibe at One Man Coffee but do go early or be prepared to wait as well due to the extremely small space."

Limited seats, call 68301156 to register now.<br&gt;<br&gt;Here were some highlights from their Penang hawkers&amp;#39; fare buffet:<br&gt;<br&gt;(1) Penang Assam Laksa<br&gt;<br&gt;- Assam laksa, the best item I had that night. A bowl of thick bee hoon (rice noodles), soaked in pipin&amp;#39; hot broth made from fish and tamarind. Sourish, full of flavours, so SHIOK! Topped with pineapple slices, chilli buddy, shredded cucumber, torch ginger and complete with a small spoonful of prawn paste. I can have this everyday! Rating 5/5<br&gt;<br&gt;(2) Prawn Noodles<br&gt;<br&gt;- This bowl of &amp;#34;hae mee&amp;#34; (prawn noodles) wasn&amp;#39;t as impressive as the laksa but was definitely comfort food. As told by the hawker chef, broth was made from piles of prawn heads, pork ribs and shells to obtain this robust consistency but I wished the taste was much stronger. Prawns given were really tiny, pork slices too dry but the rewarding part? Lotsa crispy pork lard! Rating 3/5<br&gt;<br&gt;(3) Lor Bak<br&gt;<br&gt;- A snack resembling our local fried prawn fritters (五香虾饼), this Penang version came with only 4 items; deep fried prawn, sweet potato, tau gua (fried beancurd) and handmade five-spiced meat roll. I love the meat rolls most while the other three were rather common. They were well marinated with good amount of chinese spices, not overpowering, while the meat was firm and juicy. Rating 3/5<br&gt;<br&gt;(4) Penang Rojak<br&gt;<br&gt;- This interesting plate of &amp;#34;chinese salad&amp;#34; caught my attention because of the ingredients used. Instead of the usual tau pok (fried beancurd skin) and dough fritters we had in our rojak, Penang version had jambu and green mango in it. Love the crunchiness of the fruits mixed in with the thick flavourful rojak sauce (prawn paste) and fragrant grounded peanuts. Not everybody could accept the pungent smell of prawn paste but I can and I quite like it. Rating 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;(5) Char Kway Teow<br&gt;<br&gt;- Longest queues were found infront of this char kway teow stall. Everyone patiently waited, just to get their hands on this Penang&amp;#39;s renowned char kway teow. A small plate of fried flat rice noodles in soya sauce, loaded with bean sprouts, spring onions, cockles, egg and prawn. Fragrant, savoury, semi sweet and least oily! It&amp;#39;s a waste that my plate of CKT doesn&amp;#39;t carry that smokey &amp;#34;wok hei&amp;#34; taste otherwise it would be perfect! Rating 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;(6) Kway Teow<br&gt;<br&gt;- An ordinary looking bowl of dry kway teow with fishballs and shredded chicken. But the base sauce for tossing the kway teow was so yum! A mixture of Penang sweet sauce, dark soya sauce plus sesame oil, these sauces&amp;#39; combination seems so simple yet delicious and satisfying. Rating 3/5<br&gt;<br&gt;(7) Pasembur<br&gt;<br&gt;- This year&amp;#39;s new item. A mixture of shredded cucumber pile, potato chunks, fried beancurd, Egg slice and thin crispy dough biscuits. Special? Yes, the sauce! The orange-coloured sauce on top was made from sweet potato! Sweet and slight grainy, interesting fusion taste when consume with the ingredients. Rating 3/5<br&gt;<br&gt;(8) Ban Chang Kueh<br&gt;<br&gt;- Crispy, sweet, buttery, loaded with lotsa grounded peanuts, so yummy so IRRESISTABLE! Nuff said :) Rating 5/5<br&gt;<br&gt;(9) Chendol<br&gt;<br&gt;- Personally, I felt this chendol wasn&amp;#39;t as authentic as those I tried before, especially these greeny pandan jellies (If you know what I meant). Kidney beans were nicely done and not mushy, the thick caramelized  gula melaka was a highlight too but I prefer the portion to be more. Rating 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;Other stalls&amp;#39; delicacies include Nasi Lemak with Nonya Chicken Kapitan which had very fragrant coconut rice and nicely done ikan billis chilli, Oyster omelette which lack crispiness, Cuttlefish Kangkong and dessert Ice Kacang.<br&gt;<br&gt;** The whole dining experience was really good, especially when dine with good friends. On site situation was crowded, even on a weekday Tuesday night, but all customers were really discipline and queued politely. Despite the long queues and busy nights, the hawkers cooking at individual stations were all smiles throughout. They were also kind enough to tell us more about the food recipes when asked upon. Thumbs up! Although each dish came in small portions but you could queue again, repeatedly, for your favourite choices, it&amp;#39;s buffet anyway!!<br&gt;For the price of $29++ on weekdays and $33++ on weekends, this deal was definitely worth! Hurry down before this fare ends on 27 March 2016. **"

Overall there are a dozen different dishes like Penang Laksa, Penang Char keoy  teow, Penang prawn noodle, Penang loh bak, Penang rojak etc.<br&gt;All of them are very good and worth the price instead of going to Penang. <br&gt;The dishes are served in small servings so you can try all of the dishes.

People like me who were born during that era will find it a fair bit nostalgic with their quirky chairs and toys on display.. they have those 10 cents lollipops I used to buy in Primary School sold straight from the jar. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their menu which arrived in the form of a jotterbook, which according to the staff, each and every book was painstakingly handwritten (so don&amp;#39;t go spilling drinks or food on the jotterbook since it was someone&amp;#39;s blood, sweat and tears!). They have coffee, lattes, beers, ciders, sodas and smoothies. They also have a range of cakes available and a little shisha place at the back where unlike other places, you don&amp;#39;t have to smoking by the street side with the cars zooming by and people staring at you. It&amp;#39;s a nice private enclosed open space at the back where other than the distant sounds from the other stores around Ogopogo, you can pretty much smoke in peace. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you are hungry, feel free to ask the owners for their food menu. They have an arabian food menu and an italian menu where once you order, the staff will run to the stores next door and place your order for you. <br&gt;<br&gt;I really like the ambiance of this place as it&amp;#39;s very laidback, the staff are very friendly and the drinks are delicious! Will definitely come back for more here!"

Cute little place that&amp;#39;s an undiscovered gem.. For now.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s kind of funky and retro at the same time. Tv sets, tin carriers and other old school paraphernalia sets the mood. The mad mix of mismatching chairs also adds to the charm of the place. <br&gt;<br&gt;Come here for the coffee! Using beans from Toby&amp;#39;s estate, the coffee is well balanced and easy to drink, and does not even require sugar!<br&gt;<br&gt;Other than coffee, thy also have chai lattes, craft beers and ciders available all day. Check out the Japanese Hitachino Nest flavours - the one that caught my eye was the espresso stout! Definitely an interesting taste to it! :)<br&gt;<br&gt;Lovely desserts and cakes here, ad I really enjoyed the cookies and the mango passion fruit cake there too. It went perfectly with my coffee!<br&gt;<br&gt;Because its so new, they haven&amp;#39;t really gotten a full menu set up yet. However they have partnered up with other nearby restaurants, so you can go there and enjoy a variety of cuisines such as Italian and middle eastern! But that&amp;#39;s for another review.<br&gt;<br&gt;Lastly, there&amp;#39;s a cute little outdoor area one can smoke shisha in. Really loved the entire feel and ambience of the place, and the friendly, attentive staff on duty there.<br&gt;<br&gt;Am keen to see what else Ogopogo comes up with! I&amp;#39;ll definitely be back! I&amp;#39;ve also just found out that if u call in advance, they will prepare your order and run out for a drive by takeaway! Perfect for those on the go, especially since parking can be a little tricky around that area!<br&gt;<br&gt;And I love the fact that the name is a palindrome. Make sure you check out their handwritten exercise book menus - they&amp;#39;re super cute and fun!"

The carbonara was decent but not a must have. The bouillabaisse and shepherd pie were a little disappointing, considering they were the chef&amp;#39;s special. The portions were small and did not taste what I expected of a bouillabaisse and shepherd pie. The gula melaka cake is what made this review a 4 instead of 3 - it was a little sweet but would have been perfect with a coffee. <br&gt;<br&gt;I would still recommend coming if you need a halal restaurant and am in the area."

Located right across the historic Thiam Hock Keng temple, along a cram street... you should be able to spot it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Perhaps this place is just too new as it just opened for service mid last month; hence word of mouth is still not spread around much. It was lunch time and the place was still quite vacant. Only two tables were occupied; one was the owners and probably their acquaintances. Regretted being so paranoid of taking the trouble of reserving a table. It was only about 1pm++ did we notice more and more people coming in, but there were still a lot of tables available.<br&gt;<br&gt;We were a group of 4 colleagues, lunching out together. Most of the food ordered were shared, just so we could have a bite of everything purchased. Opinions shared amongst us obviously varied. And oh! Do note that not all the photos posted here were taken by me. Haha! We shared our snaps. *giggles*<br&gt;<br&gt;We got ourselves &amp;#39;Nacho Lover&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Fried Mushroom&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Crispy Wings&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Signature Prawn &amp;amp; Crayfish Pasta&amp;#39;. For drinks and desserts, we ordered &amp;#39;Mango Creme Brulee&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Affogato&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Iced Lemon Tea&amp;#39; and... &amp;#39;Halal Champagne&amp;#39;. Yes, you read right. &amp;#39;Halal Champagne&amp;#39;: non-alcoholic. They even have &amp;#39;Halal Red Wine&amp;#39;. Two of us have never touched alcohol before, so we asked one who had and she confirmed that the taste was exactly the same as a genuine champagne. It tasted like an extreme Apple Zapple to me. *shrugs* <br&gt;<br&gt;Nachos were served with 3 different dips: cheese sauce, salsa and guacamole. Okay! Not too overpowering. Fried truffle mushrooms were a bit too soft to our liking. Then again, I dislike mushrooms. The pasta was nice but those chicken wings... Wow! Loved them! We didn&amp;#39;t share the Affogato though. But my colleague who got it did say it was good. <br&gt;<br&gt;Coming to the creme brulee though, I&amp;#39;ve tasted Chempedak and even Durian flavoured ones before, but this was the first time I had a Mango flavoured creme brulee.

Its cold, wet and you&amp;#39;re STILL falling asleep: Kopi-O - its thick, creamy and leaves a pleasant after taste of coffee, none of that nasty instant stuff! <br&gt;<br&gt;3. Gearing up for an afternoon meeting after a heavy lunch: Kopi-cino - a great sweeter alternative for coffee lovers, looks pretty as well! Half a cup of cream milk with thick kopi-o poured over. Topped with ice cubes and a generous coating of MILO POWDER. Sugar rush and caffeine all in one, POWER SEH! <br&gt;<br&gt;4. You&amp;#39;re cramping (that monthly pesky thing), bloated and just feel like something sickly and weak: Hot Ginger Milk Tea - Like what mum makes for us, but better! This tastes  a lot more palatable with the milkiness and added sweetness. It cures a morning sinus in a flash, soothes cramps and gets rid of any gas! <br&gt;<br&gt;The branch at Far East Square is by far the best - we suspect it&amp;#39;s because the adorable pigtailed aunty is really the boss of the franchise, but she keeps denying it!

I would never go or ask anyone to go to a character themed cafe. <br&gt;<br&gt;One has to preorder the meals and each meal cost $29.90 (all inclusive include tax and service charge). <br&gt;<br&gt;This is going to be one expensive lunch and of cos the two adults did not expect much from the food. <br&gt;<br&gt;When we arrived at the cafe, it was not opened. My brother was surprised cos he even came here personally a couple of days ago and made the payment. He walked over to another store which probably are related and the girl quickly went to open the cafe.<br&gt;<br&gt;The staff showed us to our table. The cafe is tiny, very tiny. I am glad I don&amp;#39;t weigh 300 lbs. There are cute plushies everywhere. It is 100% kawaii!!<br&gt;She also turned on this humongous tv which probably is over 70&amp;#34; and it started playing Kungfu Panda 3. We looked around and snapped some pictures. The staff asked if we would like to have our lunch served and we said sure. I was a little puzzled; were we supposed to play with the plushies and when hungry, asked for our food? Note: the female staff was extremely friendly and nice. The kind who I probably can go sbux with.<br&gt;<br&gt;After a very very long time, the food came. The stew or soup was nice with generous chunks of potatoes and carrots. The gyozas tasted like chinese dumplings in dim sum places. The meal also came with a beverage and a snack.<br&gt;<br&gt;The meal definitely not worth the $29.90 each pax but hey at least there was the Rila Kuji ticket which was a sure win &amp;#34;scratch &amp;amp; win&amp;#34; ticket."

The only downside to this is that I felt that it was rather pricey.<br&gt; <br&gt;The Macaron S&amp;#39;mores is also something unique to order here. The smores, which is essentially a marshmallow in between 2 macaron shells and smothered with the sauce of your liking (I chose Nutella). The smores burst upon the first mouthful. The marshmallows were soft and the Nutella made it feel more enriching. The shells were rather hard to chew on though.<br&gt; <br&gt;If you live nearby Telok Blangah, why not give this place a visit?

Still, it wasn&amp;#39;t anything to shout about. Like it&amp;#39;s coffee. And I&amp;#39;d have to be really hard pressed to make my way all the way here just for pizzas or breads.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ambience wise, it&amp;#39;s nothing really special. The chairs aren&amp;#39;t too comfortable and it&amp;#39;s got a very limited seating capacity. Definitely no good for large groups. Still it&amp;#39;s clean and cheerful, ad the glass front lets in the afternoon sun.<br&gt;<br&gt;The large colourful meringues caught my eye but I did not get any as I was stuffed from my &amp;#34;snack&amp;#34;.

If you are have about 15 minutes to spare and put in a tad more &amp;#39;effort&amp;#39;, get some tagliatelle and arrabaitta sauce to put together in the kitchen later on. Sauces tend to have little ingredients though, so stop by the Cold Storage across the road to grab something to spice it up if you will.

One of the main reasons I picked this place as opposed to one of the other stores in the food court was because this place looked very clean and had a fairly simple menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered Laksa (which has seafood) and chicken curry with rice. Also, ordered the Singaporean coffee just because its so yum. We sat behind the counter by the window which was peaceful and had a great view.<br&gt;<br&gt;Food was served very quick and portions were quite huge. Loved the laksa, and the coffee. They do not give napkins which seems to be a thing in most Singaporean places, so you might want to carry some. Staff was very friendly and helped me with my order when I wasn&amp;#39;t sure on some of the ingredients on the order."

By soft boiled, think one step away from raw. If that isn&amp;#39;t your thing, ask for the egg to be cooked longer. It&amp;#39;s delicious! Make sure you get the coffee.

They are mainly a coffee and cake kind of place but do offer a limited set of meals. The banoffee cake (banana and toffee) was really nice and recommended as their iconic cake of choice by the staff. The coffee sadly is very average.<br&gt;<br&gt;There were a lot of design types working away on laptops when I was there and I get the impression it&amp;#39;s that kind of place.

The coffee is from liberty and so I enjoy their lattes and cappuccinos. My husband swears by their French toast with bananas and bacon, which comes with two nice thick slices of eggy fried brioche, sliced bananas, crispy bacon all drenched in maple syrup! The sweet and savory combo wins him over. <br&gt;<br&gt;For me I always end up with the pork cheek sandwich. I agree with Marcus L, a little bit more toasted would be great. But once Ive sunk my teeth into that porky, cheesy, oily goodness I forget all about it. The small salad that comes with it lets me delude myself of it being pretty healthy. <br&gt;<br&gt;Not managed to try much else at this cafe, I like that the seats are reasonably spaced out and I always manage somehow to get a table. So just based on that sandwich and French toast, will keep Flock cafe as my default place to go."

Somehow it feels genuine and laid-back, which can hardly be said for nearby establishments like Forty Hands and Open Door Policy, both of which have amassed loyal cult followings (quite deservedly) and lost their chill factor in the process. Well I suppose crowds are a good thing for cafes to have, though it would be nice to be able to have a meal without feeling like I&amp;#39;m in someone else&amp;#39;s way all the time.<br&gt;<br&gt;These crowds were absent from Flock when we visited one Saturday afternoon for tea. Bit of a welcome change from having to wait in the sweltering heat for a table. It wasn&amp;#39;t that the eatery was devoid of people - there was a steady trickle of customers, and the staff looked hard at work.<br&gt;<br&gt;Portobello, mozzarella &amp;amp; rocket sandwich, $13.50 - Since this was supposed to be tea we ordered one of their sandwiches to share. T&amp;#39;was a pricey sandwich, but I liked that the juicy portobello shroom was so big it occupied the entire pocket of ciabatta. This was quite delicious and would have made a substantial lunch for one, though y&amp;#39;know, the pig in me wishes they had fries on the side.<br&gt;<br&gt;They have other interesting offerings on their sandwich list like prawn and avocado, as well as pork cheek and gruyere.<br&gt;<br&gt;Orange bundt cake, $5.00 - Having had a disappointing encounter with a bundt cake the week before, we decided to give the orange bundt cake here a shot. I thought it had a nice citrusy fragrance and crumbled quite satisfactorily, but the others found it to be a little too dry.<br&gt;<br&gt;Mocha, $6.00 - Flock sources its beans from the ever-reliable Liberty Coffee, which pretty much ensures quality coffee brews. The mocha we had was frothy, chocolatey and every sip was laced with a pleasant hint of bitterness.<br&gt;<br&gt;In line with their philosophy of providing a &amp;#34;deliberately relaxed&amp;#34; ambiance conducive for weekend catch up sessions between friends, Flock was modestly, yet comfortably furnished and I loved the warm lighting. The food here is above average, and it&amp;#39;s a lovely place to spend a lazy day, as all my weekends tend to be. Wouldn&amp;#39;t mind coming back at all."

Without jumping in the kitchen, I&amp;#39;d say go have the big breakfast at Food For Thought to see what I mean by a good, even scramble. The rashes of bacon seemed to be lifted straight out of a packet into the pan because they were all stuck together.

The cappuccino met my standards (taste-wise) and was quite pretty, latte art-wise!<br&gt;<br&gt;I love the ambiance here; for some reason, I didn&amp;#39;t find it as cramped as 40 Hands, around the corner. The natural lighting (my favourite!) is great, and they also have covered outdoor seating, which is perfect for a rainy day.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, another great spot for enjoying a bite to eat, a latte to drink, and perhaps an occasional Instagram selfie (as much as I hate them, it&amp;#39;s amazing how natural lighting + a filter works wonders for a tired face!)"

Having to look at instagram posts and menu, we noticed that they are popular for their black ink dishes. So we decided to order 黑 Rice, Black Sea, Crab Roll and Truffle fries to share.<br&gt;<br&gt;All of us love the 黑 Rice. From its presentation, decent proportion of the rice and the fried chicken as well as the egg. The rice tasted like Kampong Fried Rice with rich flavour. However, was quite confused as I didn&amp;#39;t taste the black ink and it was just for the rice appearance. Overall, its a must order whenever anyone visit there, with the black ink taste or not. <br&gt;<br&gt;The crab roll was satisfactory as well. There was a lot of filling and the bun was crispy outside and soft inside, it was perfectly baked. <br&gt;<br&gt;The least favourite dish of the day was the Black Sea. Although I can taste the black ink in the pasta, however the seafood was undercooked as so it was tough to eat. The flavour was only decent and the portion size is very small. <br&gt;<br&gt;Truffle fries was great. Unlike most of the truffle fries out there, we can really smell and taste the truffle. <br&gt;<br&gt;In conclusion, the winner of the day is the 黑 Rice and I would gladly recommend it to my friends. While the crab roll was satisfactory, i think both the roll and black sea portion need to be improved as we are playing quite a lot for the dishes. At the end of the day I can only remember I was full because of the fries.<br&gt;<br&gt;Serving was good and the waitresses were attentive and full of smiles."

Cauliflower fritters - decent with a nice dipping sauce but was a little too over fried, I think the cauliflower would have done equally well roasted and would have been even better and healthier<br&gt;2. Black rice with steak - really loved the texture of the rice which was bouncy and chewy and delicious with the Japanese mayo and tobiko! The steak was surprisingly juicy and not overcooked.<br&gt;3. Buccatini with thick cut bacon - this was disappointing, the sauce had no flavor (squid ink) and the bacon was really salty. The bacon however, did balance out the pasta which had no flavor. We agreed that this would have done better with udon rather than using a pasta.<br&gt;<br&gt;We had tea and coffee as well, all of which were fine but nothing stood out. I would go back if I lived/worked in the area, but wouldn&amp;#39;t make a special trip."

The Tonkatsu Ricotta, Salmon Dish, and Fish w/Potatoes were a few of my fav dishes. I am personally not a huge fan of potatoes but was very delighted to find theirs come in stringed shape, almost like noodles (see pic)<br&gt;<br&gt;Menu items I didn&amp;#39;t like as much: <br&gt;- The Berry Hotcakes are also quite popular here, serving a generous portion of berries. The Hotcakes are very thick and filling however, and best for sharing among a group of 5-8 people (definitely not for one person). <br&gt;- The Pink Pasta was quite thick/creamy and small in portion size. I personally am not a huge fan of creamy pastas however so I may be biased here. <br&gt;- I also got to try the Garlic Fries as a side item, and found it to be the most mediocre item on the menu (among many exceptional items). <br&gt;<br&gt;Additional factors:<br&gt;- Location is a bit out of the way (need to taxi)<br&gt;- You pay the price. I went as a group of 3, ordering 3 mains, 1 side, and 2 coffees. The bill came out to $105 (and this was over lunch)!<br&gt;<br&gt;I definitely want to come back to try their other items.

Buona Vista (nearer to Pasir Panjang) is this hipster cafe. There will be a row of shophouses and it is next to the intersection of Lorong Sarhad.<br&gt;<br&gt;Came here on a Monday around 1.30pm for my cousin&amp;#39;s birthday party. Since my mother and I were the last one to arrive, some dishes are laid on the long dining table and we could taste some of the leftovers.<br&gt;<br&gt;Tried the risotto. Since it has been out for awhile before I arrive, the taste was not too great. We also tried the hot chick (fried &amp;#34;popcorn&amp;#34; chicken). Pretty well done as it was served after we arrived. The homemade chilli on the side did pair well with the chicken bites. The chicken skin was crunchy and the meat itself was juicy when served.<br&gt;<br&gt;My aunt then decided to order Kimchi Fried Rice for both my mother and I. We did not wait for long for it. When it arrived, it came in a bigger portion than expected (serves up to 2 or 3 pax). The lighting at the longest table was not that great hence I had to snap a quick photo before tasting the dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;For this dish, I love the steak slices. I ordered medium well and it turned out chewy and juicy to my likings. The kimchi portion for this dish was small. Would prefer it to be slightly more. The steaks definitely overpowered the flavors in the dish. For the rice, it was well-fried. The color of the fried rice were constant throughout the dish and the flavors linger in the mouth. Definitely one of the recommended dish here.<br&gt;<br&gt;I managed to try the &amp;#34;famous and instagramable&amp;#34; Berry Ricotta hotcakes. The berries were sweet and well-spread around the hotcakes. But the hotcakes itself was a little dry for me. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was not bad either. The staffs approached quickly when you raised your hand. Price wise, it would be better if it is slightly cheaper. Will be back to try out other dishes."

The large windows, industrial-chic looking interior, differently textured walls of concrete, plywood and neon lighting already scream hipster before you enter. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s rather comfortable inside as you settle down and start looking at the menu. Some items are meant for sharing and the rest were noodle or yakitori dishes. I was very intrigued by the fusion dishes and proceeded to order the fried man tou sliders and toasted spicy rice cakes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Six fried man tou sliders arrived arranged on a large plate with two different sauces and a side of truffle fries. I was more impressed with the pork belly sliders than the lamb sliders, which I felt were too lean and dry. The korean rice cakes (Tteokbokki) arrived with a suitably crispy and slightly charred exterior with a spicy sauce mixed with a raw egg, salmon roe (ikura) and some pork slices. Although I enjoyed the juxtaposition of textures and flavors, the sauce was too salty for my liking.<br&gt;<br&gt;The coffee, however, is decently good. I saw the USD$21,000 Slayer(tm) machine sitting on the counter. I also think they get their beans from a local roaster. Earlier, I observed staff members at the bar fiddle with the Slayer(tm) espresso machine and attempt to coax it to deliver the right consistency of caffeine shot.<br&gt;<br&gt;Prices are much higher to compensate for not levying a service charge. I&amp;#39;m a little on the fence as the food is interesting but being a week old meant they still had a lot of kinks to iron out. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their wait staff were still rather new and confused on procedure, and the kitchen took a really long time (45 mins) to churn out the dishes before running out of food and closing early at 8:45pm.

Small breakfast was polenta and a runny egg on toast, with the morning-welcome fragance of mushrooms and truffle. Hotcake was fantastic despite the 30-minute wait - great on the palatte and the eyes.

Another perk, no GST either! <br&gt;<br&gt;That said, my grouse was mainly regarding the menu, it tended towards unnecessary and wasted pretense. If a menu requires Dr Google&amp;#39;s assistance to make an informed decision, that&amp;#39;s far too much posturing. I mean, how many regular people know what bagna cauda is? Or even how to pronounce it?! <br&gt;<br&gt;Also, a girlfriend took issue with the mispresentation on the menu. What was named &amp;#39;Hash Hash&amp;#39; with a description of &amp;#34;sauteed beef, mushroom, chorizo, doughstick and sous vide egg&amp;#34; turned out to be a beef bak kut teh. Calling a dish &amp;#34;hash&amp;#34;, she said, and I quite agree, implies that the whole jin-gang is sauteed, as you would a breakfast hash. A soupy bak kut teh IS NOT a hash. Strip away the pretense, I think, and re-direct the effort to the food. That&amp;#39;s what draws in the crowds anyway.<br&gt;<br&gt;We had:<br&gt;<br&gt;1) Berry Ricotta Hotcake ($23) adorned with blueberry sugar, pinenuts, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, yuzu gel, and maple syrup: Very pretty, and it tasted as good as it looked. Thick, dense, but fluffy, these were the best pancakes I&amp;#39;ve had for as long as I can remember.<br&gt;<br&gt;2) Quesadillas ($20) stuffed with pulled duck and pickles, served with charred baby capsicum and sweet corn, and sided by a garlic aioli and guacamole: The quesadillas, in addition to being laced with parsley, were mediocre. My parsley-loving friend, who had this, said to give this a hard pass.<br&gt;<br&gt;3) Hash Hash ($24): Misleading description aside, this was a reasonably commendable and very comforting bowl of beef bak kut teh. Meltingly soft and wonderfully fatty, the luscious hunks of meat could have passed off as pork if I hadn&amp;#39;t been informed otherwise. I particularly liked the western twist of the sous vide egg, arugula leaves, and chickpeas.<br&gt;<br&gt;4) Kimchi Fried Rice ($20): much touted, but turned out middling, even with the perfectly wobbly sous vide egg, and medium-well tender steak.

All you could smell walking into the cafe was truffle oil. Me - truffle fan - was overjoyed. The menu was pretty enticing too. Lots of great brunch choices. The sour-faced cashier took our order not too willingly. <br&gt;Coffee we got were flat whites. Can&amp;#39;t go wrong with them. They were made pretty well except that it was served in a cup slightly bigger than an expresso cup. Size wise, disappointing for the $5 price tag. <br&gt;The food arrived pretty soon after. I had the croque madame, a sunny side up on top of two dry and thick pieces of bread with ham bacon and a measly amount of cheese. This is not how you do a croque Madame. No way. The cheese was pathetic, they were so stingy with it that it didn&amp;#39;t even ooze out. Usually a croque Madame would have some béchamel sauce and cheese melted on it. Nope. This was dry, tasteless and not worth $16. The sarnies I make (and I don&amp;#39;t cook much) are way better. Really not cool to disappoint someone who wanted great brunch. <br&gt;My friend had the poached eggs with smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce. The sauce was not too bad but the eggs were overcooked. No runny egg yolks oozing out when you cut them. Well, isn&amp;#39;t the runnier texture the point of poached eggs? <br&gt;We got the chicken wings too. These were just battered wings that were deep fried without any seasoning. It was a what the... moment when we bit into the chicken. Unforgivable. <br&gt;<br&gt;My take: if you want to be a coffee joint, then stick to it. Don&amp;#39;t offer food you don&amp;#39;t know or can&amp;#39;t make well. The coffee here, yes. The food, never again. The cashier could do with a smile on her face too."

It came with a small side salad that was lettuce greens and tomatoes. The chicken was covered with a cheesy (I think) sauce. It was just meh.

The core was pumped up with light chestnut cream and one could inhale whiffs of eggy aroma in the pillowy sponge. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Matcha Cake is a simple construction of green tea mousse, azuki beans and sponge.

How I always look forward to the family bonding over a good meal. This weekend we decided to check out the Bakery &amp;amp; Bar St Marc at Greenland Park (new section at East coast park). We absolutely loved the vibe and the area surrounding of the restaurant. In front of the restaurant is a green field facing the sea. It&amp;#39;s definitely a place for family to bring kids. <br&gt;<br&gt;Also, Interestingly I think this might be the first St Marc outlet to offer food, other than just breads, pastries and desserts. Inside, The restaurant is rather spacious and can cater for big groups. <br&gt;<br&gt;Once seated we asked for cold water for the family. We were then told 1 jug of water was $1. What?! It could have been tap water for all we know and it&amp;#39;s $1?! Are we paying for their utility bills or what?! Seriously... Anyway no choice we took 3 skinny jugs for our family of 8. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our order include:<br&gt;1. Kids fish &amp;amp; chips (2 tiny pieces with tiny shoe string fries)<br&gt;2. Spaghetti bolognese<br&gt;3. Prawn aglio olio<br&gt;4. Seafood spaghetti<br&gt;5. Wagyu beef burger (served with tiny shoe string fries) <br&gt;<br&gt;When the food arrived, To be honest, the portions were all rather small even by a lady&amp;#39;s standard. The nephew who ate the wagyu beef burger enjoyed it, he said the beef was cooked just right and was juicy and delicious. The rest of us had only a phrase to describe our seafood/prawn pasta - &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s like hokkien mee&amp;#34;. Ok don&amp;#39;t get us wrong, the pastas were tasty. The sauce for the seafood pasta had a good broth base that made it very flavorful.  The seafood and prawns used were very fresh. But the style of pasta, the execution is more Japanese than Italian. <br&gt;<br&gt;What&amp;#39;s also surprising was that they don&amp;#39;t charge service charge or GST. Hmmm... That sort of appeased our frustrations with having to pay for ice water. :)<br&gt;<br&gt;On the whole I think this is an ok and versatile place where one can have the flexibility of having tea to actual meal, whilst having the space outside for the kids to run and play. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ps. Greenland park is situated at East Coast Park, car park area C1. Parking may be quite difficult to get over the weekend."

Unfortunately, it tasted very much like American-Italian - in this case I suppose it&amp;#39;d be Australian-Italian although I haven&amp;#39;t had Italian food in Australia. It&amp;#39;d probably be the equivalent of having pasta at Buca Di Beppo in California. I liked that the flavours were strong, but what I enjoyed about the dish ended there. It wasn&amp;#39;t refined at all - it tasted heavy and cloying, and not in a good way the way comfort food can be. The ravioli skins were far too thick - imagine fat floury soggy dumpling wrappers - and were stuffed with cheese that was the wrong texture. The hazelnuts also ended up adding to the density of the dish as well, when I could&amp;#39;ve used some herbs or greens to lighten and freshen the dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m giving it three stars overall because I&amp;#39;d try some of the other (probably non-pasta) dishes if I do go back. Ambience overall was cute, though I can see why another reviewer said it leaned toward ramshackle rather than rustic."

We got two half&amp;amp;halfs - Chilli Crab and Pepperoni as well as Forest Mushroom and Parma Ham with Rocket. The pizzas are the thin crust variety which is perfect for when you&amp;#39;re feeling peckish and not wanting to feel too full too quickly. I&amp;#39;d really recommend the Chilli Crab, my Favorite among the lot we chose. Truffle fries were decent, as with the flat whites. Spotted their promotion on margaritas when I was in the Ladies midway through our meal and decided to get a carafe of Strawberry Margarita to ease into the evening. Frozen margarita was a good idea; tangy refreshing and very much welcomed on the palate after too much carbs between two girls. A word of caution for the slow sipper though, frozen beverages doesn&amp;#39;t take too kindly to our harsh humid weather so it didn&amp;#39;t take too long till we had a quarter of our carafe left with unattractive slush floating on lukewarm pink liquid - and we were seated indoors!

The coffee here is the best in the east side of town and is pretty near my place. Happiness!<br&gt;<br&gt;I prefer ordering a piccolo as its stronger and more aromatic. The glasses for the latte are a little big, so the coffee gets quite weak and diluted. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got to say, the service here is pretty good! The waitresses seemed a little hesitant and inexperienced, but yet were friendly and polite.<br&gt;<br&gt;Also, when I asked about the latte tasting weak, the barista came over and recommended the piccolo. After that I noticed they only charged me for my first order. When I brought this up, they said the piccolo was on the house as I was unsatisfied with the latte. :)<br&gt;<br&gt;The food here is of good quality! Ive tried the breakfast menu and was very satisfied with the eggs Benedict and big breakfast. Prices are a little steep but take advantage of the promotions on at the moment!<br&gt;<br&gt;Weekday mains charged at 25% off, while on weekends, you get a free coffee when you order a brunch main before 4pm! Not sure when the promo ends but i was just there last week and it was still on!<br&gt;<br&gt;The rib eye sandwich and chicken pesto sandwich were both lovely, nestled inside very yummy bread. However the buns for the Melba burger were a bit too doughy for me, though the ingredients inside we&amp;#39;re fresh and the beef patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare juicy delight.<br&gt;<br&gt;Great ambience and it&amp;#39;s great for families as there&amp;#39;s a large field out front, and I&amp;#39;ve seen an inflatable bouncy castle on weekends!"

Spotted their promotion on margaritas when I was in the Ladies midway through our meal and decided to get a carafe of Strawberry Margarita to ease into the evening. Frozen margarita was a good idea; tangy refreshing and very much welcomed on the palate after too much carbs between two girls. A word of caution for the slow sipper though, frozen beverages doesn&amp;#39;t take too kindly to our harsh humid weather so it didn&amp;#39;t take too long till we had a quarter of our carafe left with unattractive slush floating on lukewarm pink liquid - and we were seated indoors!

The glasses for the latte are a little big, so the coffee gets quite weak and diluted. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got to say, the service here is pretty good! The waitresses seemed a little hesitant and inexperienced, but yet were friendly and polite.<br&gt;<br&gt;Also, when I asked about the latte tasting weak, the barista came over and recommended the piccolo. After that I noticed they only charged me for my first order. When I brought this up, they said the piccolo was on the house as I was unsatisfied with the latte. :)<br&gt;<br&gt;The food here is of good quality! Ive tried the breakfast menu and was very satisfied with the eggs Benedict and big breakfast. Prices are a little steep but take advantage of the promotions on at the moment!<br&gt;<br&gt;Weekday mains charged at 25% off, while on weekends, you get a free coffee when you order a brunch main before 4pm! Not sure when the promo ends but i was just there last week and it was still on!<br&gt;<br&gt;The rib eye sandwich and chicken pesto sandwich were both lovely, nestled inside very yummy bread. However the buns for the Melba burger were a bit too doughy for me, though the ingredients inside we&amp;#39;re fresh and the beef patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare juicy delight.<br&gt;<br&gt;Great ambience and it&amp;#39;s great for families as there&amp;#39;s a large field out front, and I&amp;#39;ve seen an inflatable bouncy castle on weekends!"

It&amp;#39;s clean slices of flour and dough with some meat, vegetable and cheese toppings on it. These pizzas are extremely thin and you may eat them with a choice of 3 sauces that are given to you - pesto, olive and chick peas sauce. The price range is a bit high. The quality of service is pretty good. And the ambience is the best part of the place. They have a very cool outdoor space seating area with wooden benches and tables.

First time went to this chain and it totally blown my mind. Those makciks definitely know how to make their putu piring to perfection even to the last bite. It was served in a brown wrapper piping hot. The putu piring was fluffy with a hint of sweetness with its palm sugar that melt in your mouth and a good portion of fresh grated coconut for you to eat with. Definitely my kind of dessert. I had to have another serving cause one wasn&amp;#39;t enough. It&amp;#39;s that good.

Alot of customers were getting cakes to go.<br&gt;And this was the end results, hardly any cakes left, compared to what I saw earlier in the day.<br&gt;Pretty much 50% of their menu were also sold out!<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Earl Grey Tea Cake $5<br&gt;I decided to quickly grab the last two slices of cake in the display and it was definitely worth my while. This was more like a pound cake that tasted like tea, with a hard sugary top coating. It was quite dense and great to share amongst two people.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Tropical Earl Grey $6<br&gt;So moist and so good! Best cake ever!This is by far, my favourite cake. Do not like the layers of cream intimidate you, the cream isn&amp;#39;t sweet, the cake is super moist and I even got two more slices to take home with me. Even with the cakes sitting in the fridge for 1-2 days, the cake remained moist! The tea flavour was present in every bite, and you can even smell it!<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Peppermint Iced ChocolatePeppermint Iced Chocolate $5.50<br&gt;This literally tasted like an &amp;#34;After-Eight&amp;#34; chocolate in a liquid form, the peppermint flavour wasn&amp;#39;t too overpowering and the chocolate was very real and not too heaty. My friend and I enjoyed this so much!<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Salmon Guacamole $9.50<br&gt;I feel that for $9.50, this was worth every penny! There was so much salmon, I couldn&amp;#39;t find enough bread to eat it with the salmon! The salmon tasted great and the bread was very crispy and toasty. It stayed crispy even after 10-15 minutes.<br&gt;<br&gt;5. Affogato $7<br&gt;One dose of Affogato at noon wasn&amp;#39;t enough, I needed a second dose! Ice cream, coffee and gula melaka! It&amp;#39;s heavenly, I will definitely be ordering this every single time I step into Penny University! The smell of the caffeine, just wakes you up!<br&gt;Cakes and the Salmon Guacamole, a perfect dinner time treat, along with the Affogato, even though almost the entire kitchen was wiped out of food and we couldn&amp;#39;t order anything else, I was still a very happy customer. <br&gt;<br&gt;Great Cakes, Great Service and Great Coffee = Happy Customers like Me :)"

We are incapable of fore-speaking the future, the same goes to any economist and policy makers, hence we are in no way to crystal-ball their success, until perseverance turned fruitful.<br&gt;<br&gt;Peculiar name it has. A coffee shop - deck out interestingly in modern lighting fixtures, serving you in its customized bar and counter table tops using recycled railroad ties (by THE RAIL LIFE CO.), with a raw finishing - polished cement flooring. I walked in and find myself a table seat, adjacent to the communal table. I wish I had a chance to the booth seat for a more enclosed space or that little couch corner for a homely feel, still I had a wonderful time just people watching in the open area. I returned to the counter for my orders. The menu clip on a wooden board is not long, making your choice is a lot more easier. Serving a small range of breakfast and a few selection of tea/coffee, the friendly young lady took the orders on her electronic portable tablet. While I am charmed by the catchy wood-cut coffee menu pinned on the wall, I find the old rustic-looking cash register very striking. I don&amp;#39;t seem to spot any functioning one (no receipts-paperless &amp;amp; they accept only Cash), how cool.<br&gt;<br&gt;Seconds after I made payment, I find myself honing after some treats. The see-through display shelved some mouth-watering cakes, pies, tarts (supplied by other home-grown bakeries, by Fluff Bakery, Windowsillpies)  Surely I have missed the pop-up cookies store - my lovebites on their Salted caramel butter biscuits but still managed to try a piece of  that crunchy earl grey tea almond ones.<br&gt;<br&gt;A bit nosy I confessed. I have to bring myself to ask why Penny University and not any others? Mouss - the barista &amp;amp; owner, was busy brewing his delicate Brazilian blend, from Oriole Coffee &amp;amp; Nylon Coffee Roaster. The guy who spent time learning from teachers at the London BRAT, find me hard to ignore as I was standing right in front of this World Barista champ weapon - La Marzocco. Speaking in a soft tone, he lyrically described the coffee beans used, the history behind the store name et cetra. And so, I came to know that Penny University is a term coiled in London during the 18-century - a coffeehouse where people of ALL levels are charged a penny to enter and have free access to coffee, company, latest news from reporters (&amp;#34;runners&amp;#34;), gossips, newspapers and bulletins. Many more coffee shops over the world then, were named &amp;#34;Penny University&amp;#34;. How interesting to know that&amp;#39;s how social networking came about and its evolution, wasn&amp;#39;t it?<br&gt;<br&gt;I learn to appreciate how things fall into place, how each new start-up was conceptualized &amp;amp; established. The process was lengthy but each baby steps were taken painstakingly with great passion. Likewise, the 7-ounce of simply coffee and water bond together brilliantly with careful brewing method - a clean &amp;amp; creamy mouth-feel, less harsh. Honestly, I&amp;#39;d prefer this to the one using Papa Palheta roast.<br&gt;<br&gt;The breakfast toasties definitely amp up my lazy morning. I opted for a single toast instead of two but regretted as the marmite spreading the toast was marvelous. I used to make myself a slice at home but hardly these days, so when I saw them on the menu, I just know this it it! A deliberate amount is used so no worries about being overly-salted. The taste was made even more paramount when paired with cheese, supremely good! Then comes the poached eggs and a handful of rocket leaves salad to wrap up your morning - what an awakening!<br&gt;<br&gt;<a href=""http://www.yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/penny-university-singapore?select=6z8a_uFhtyaYUh1KpH0bkg#3Vb5GfwUpBEDeYQrk0gtkg""&gt;yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/p…</a&gt;<br&gt;<br&gt;If you find the marmite extract too acquiring, they offer sourdough toast with butter, marmalade &amp;amp; fig condiments. I like the amount of heat that browned each round slices but I didn&amp;#39;t seem to be able to locate its tangy taste. It needed a greater dose of levain. Of course, they have a few more options available.<br&gt;<br&gt;<a href=""http://www.yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/penny-university-singapore?select=6z8a_uFhtyaYUh1KpH0bkg#6z8a_uFhtyaYUh1KpH0bkg""&gt;yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/p…</a&gt;<br&gt;<br&gt;The Rock Cake makes a fabulous teatime treat. The Great Britain first had them during the WWII as one of the rationed food item. Quintessentially, a fruit cake with a jagged contour but minute-sized. Scone-alike, this fruit bun is somewhat moist and crumbly. The candied jumbo-sized dried cranberry &amp;amp; raisin fruits complement the cake which has been baked universally less sweet. Accompanied by a cup of brew - unmistakable. Enjoying this classics of British food, I can now claim to be part of the Harry Potter&amp;#39;s gang.<br&gt;<br&gt;I know many dwellers in the east will make this their second home, sipping a minimal 3-ounce and engaged in a chitter-chatter."

The tart crust is like a fantastic butter cookie (sables anyone?), the creme patissiere is light and delicious, and the fruit is always good quality. I am always literally sad when I&amp;#39;m done eating one.<br&gt;<br&gt;I also tried the quiche which was excellent - really awesome pastry, super light egg custard, and delicious fillings! I could have done away with the bacon, but the mushroom and onions in there were divine.<br&gt;<br&gt;Surprisingly, the tea was of decent quality although I can&amp;#39;t remember the name of it right now. And although it costs $8 a pot (when I was last there), it&amp;#39;s good enough that you can steep the leaves again a couple of times so you get more bang for your buck.<br&gt;<br&gt;I would take a star off for the price (which is pretty exorbitant but quite standard for pastry these days) but it&amp;#39;s so good..

Simply too many choices with a limited gastro-capacity. How much can you stomach each day? After all, I am no Adam Richman of Man vs Food who is all out to conquer the most compelling food that keeps populating without any sign of slowing down. The food scene is getting more electrifying and when it becomes explosive, it will be unimaginable. Positively yet, I enjoy the random pick.<br&gt;<br&gt;For 3 years now, it seems to me that there are new breakfast parlors &amp;amp; coffee joints opening every month. All-day-breakfast and coffee tasting (surpassing wine tasting these days) becomes suddenly fashionable. Many are made to rediscover the art of coffee drinking and cultivate the new societal norm of brunching. No one could be spared.<br&gt;<br&gt;While some are untroubled by queues, others like myself, gets irk by it. Those that comes with a long line, therefore needs either entice me with real stuff or delude me with some marketing gimmicks which I may fall trap at times. With a bit of luck, one could still find authentic flavourful eatery without having to join the crowd in the bustling street of Orchard - but allow me to echo; &amp;#34;that&amp;#39;s when you are in luck.&amp;#34; Betting at it, I seek out the less congested spot in downtown.         <br&gt;<br&gt;Nestling along a quieter lane at Killiney road, this 5 year old deli-bakery shop is a stone away from the signature kaya toast at Killiney Kopitiam. I remembered savouring the optional coconutty kaya jam &amp;amp; that slightly salted slab of butter that cuddle 2 slices of warm French toast and washed down with a cup of old-fashion brewed coffee. And today, I met with Freshly Baked by Le Bijoux for a similar nostalgia experience - no queue absolutely.<br&gt;<br&gt;I enjoyed its unpretentious makeup with sturdy wooden dining furnitures, withholding some traditional elements. The well-ventilated shophouse is most welcoming. But more inviting is the lady behind the baking countertop who was once the executive pastry chef at Saint Pierre who struck out on her 5 years ago. This baker - Audrey has tempt patrons with her homemade sweet cinnamon loaf, butter cake, walnut raisin bread. Some make their way there for the affordable breakfast sets (nett prices). I hear them, and so I turn up.<br&gt;<br&gt;I was greeted with a firm but friendly tone, the moment I stepped into the shop. The place was empty at 2pm on a Saturday. I quickly pick up the menu placed in an acrylic holder against the wall. Without delay, I went up to the payment counter to make my order and pay for them. The cake choices in the glass shelving were narrow - forget about having any fanciful slices, Audrey bakes traditional confections.<br&gt;<br&gt;The burger bap (Brunch B - S$9.50) arrived with a loud bang. The sizeable bun came with an authentic softness with an easy to chew texture and airy interior, nothing more. The salt-cured beef slices didn&amp;#39;t taste too briny but a little too greasy. Instead of assembling them into a à la mode burger, I forked the sunny side-up and get excited watching the yolk exploding in all direction atop the bap. The result was a moist and eggy bread combo. Unimpressed, the baked bean stood motionless on the plate. Though it didn&amp;#39;t wow me greatly, I appreciate the homely bread offered.<br&gt;<br&gt;2 slices of thick wholemeal bread helped fix one&amp;#39;s hunger pangs. I feel the crust crackling apart as it revealed large to medium air pockets in the crumbs. I figured that I tasted too many well-baked European breads these days that the ones I had here failed to surprise me further. The set (Brunch A - S$10.90) came with some crisp bacon strips and a pool of moist but bland scrambled egg. The stalk of romaine looked out of place on the plate; too little to call it salad, too bulky on its own - I don&amp;#39;t understand. Still, I am pleased by the customer-oriented gesture here. I feel good not for the cappuccino but the biding good-bye when you make your exit to the door.<br&gt;<br&gt;Next time if you are walking down the Killiney lane with a sudden crave for a homemade loaf, Freshly Baked could be your antidote. Unless you are too starved to walk, the brunch could be your saviour. But I will not succumb to any hunger beast to eat my fill, I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind dragging my feet a few inches away. <br&gt;<br&gt;With bountiful options, I feel indebted to EDB and have to praise them for shaping Singapore&amp;#39;s economy which includes the food industry, even if they are not the only invisible hand behind it."

I guess the fact that the family before us also ordered it confirmed that it was a good idea. Anyway, it didn&amp;#39;t taste super rich (although, I have no idea about the actual butter content, haha) and was slightly spongey, chockful of cranberries, nice touch of caramelized sugar in the middle of the top, and good crust! <br&gt;<br&gt;One of my favourite scones in Singapore so far :) Although granted, I haven&amp;#39;t had that many.. Next to try will be the huge ones from Gastronomia Da Paolo. <br&gt;<br&gt;Bf and I tried their chocolate salted caramel tart previously, that was so-so though. I was expecting a crispier/crunchier tart base but this one was soft. I like my buttery tart bases so this one didn&amp;#39;t quite cut it. The crunchy choc balls on top added nice texture though! Also, bf&amp;#39;s complaint was that there wasn&amp;#39;t v much salted caramel (which is true). It was very rich and gooey with choc/caramel filling though."

They are so addictive; they were all i could think about after dining here the first time.

The most popular order is the deli corned beef from Huber&amp;#39;s Butchery paired with baked beans, a fried egg and burger bag bread. While i was there, i tried the Fresh deli Salami served with Emmental cheese, scrambled eggs and olive oil bread (S$12.90).<br&gt;<br&gt;Even though the scrambled egg was more like omelette (and a little bland), the bread was faultless. It&amp;#39;s kinda like an English muffin with the slightly rough exterior but it&amp;#39;s moist and dense on the inside and yet it still maintains the slightly fluffiness.

On the one hand, I am elated that Marine Cove has reopened after being closed for more than 4 years. On the other hand, this is NOT the same Marine Cove that we know so well. <br&gt;<br&gt;Take a look at this website to see how Marine Cove used to look like when it first opened more than 30 years ago in 1982. <a href=""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fremembersingapore.org%2F2012%2F03%2F15%2Fmemories-at-marine-cove-mcdonalds%2F&amp;amp;s=ed317c262951d003c2bcf459936a9c1fb25e38ea3ee9cd0d61a86708bbd744ee"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""&gt;remembersingapore.org/20…</a&gt; <br&gt;<br&gt;I feel super nostalgic and also quite sad looking at the old pictures from this blog. One of my friends summed it up very well: the new Marine Cove is just NOT the old Marine Cove. Sadly, it is true ; (<br&gt;<br&gt;My friends and I used to hang out at Marine Cove area very often during our teenage years. The catchphrase then was &amp;#34;meet at McD&amp;#39;s&amp;#34;. We would meet at McD&amp;#39;s, then head out to the beach for our activities - be it BBQing, Cycling, Roller-blading, Strolling along the beach, Watching the sunset, Jogging, Dancing on the beach at night! (YES we did the dancing part lol!), Camping in the Tents and much much more. #sweetmemories<br&gt;<br&gt;However, after all the musings and &amp;#34;wiping away the tears&amp;#34; (being drama mama here), I am very happy that Marine Cove has reopened at the exact spot where its predecessor used to be. That&amp;#39;s because the authorities seemed to have other non-F&amp;amp;B related plans for the location when they demolished the original Marine Cove.<br&gt;<br&gt;What you can find at the new Marine Cove (opened on 28 June 2016):<br&gt;<br&gt;(1) McDonald&amp;#39;s -- Anchor tenant for sure! <br&gt;The business there has been just crazy since it opened on 2 July 2016. I thought of getting a dessert or fillet-o-fish last night (3rd day of operation), but the queues were pretty long, so I will go again another day.<br&gt;<br&gt;(2) Coffee Bean &amp;amp; Tea Leaf Cafe - The biggest CBTL in SG to-date<br&gt;<br&gt;(3) Other eateries: Babalicious (Local Peranakan Food), Hill Street Coffee Shop (Local Food - local coffee &amp;amp; kaya breads), My Briyani House (Local Malay Food)<br&gt;<br&gt;What I like about the new Marine Cove: It is NEW!! It is very functional, with all the eateries housed inside a big squarish building. <br&gt;<br&gt;I think what I LOVE most about the new Marine Cove is the very big and interesting 3500sqm playground for the kids! I am fully intending to visit the park often in the days to come, observing how the kids enjoy themselves and maybe take a picture or two #ilovetakingpicsoftoddlerschildren <br&gt;<br&gt;Take a visit to Marine Cove - for those of you who remember the old Marine Cove, and the ones who have never been to its well-loved predecessor, I believe both groups would have a good time here. A big incentive to attract you to Marine Cove? Have a nice meal or cuppa, and then head out to the beach thereafter. <br&gt;<br&gt;Welcome back Marine Cove! #youhavebeenmissed"

While many may say that the toast or the eggs are not very special or that the food is expensive but one of the biggest draws for me is the convenience of the drinks to go. They are pretty efficient with the dual counters and dual queue system which enables the crazy, hungry and thirsty crowd at Raffles Place to get their drinks to go.<br&gt;<br&gt;The other big plus for me is that the cashier has somehow identified me as a regular and remember what my usual order is (I tend to buy large amounts of honey lemon drinks to go) and she is ever cheerful and helpful, sometimes giving me good recommendation for new drinks I&amp;#39;d like to try.<br&gt;<br&gt;The honey lemon here comes with 2 slices of lemon and a very generous amount of honey to sweeten things up. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say they use great honey but when you do try to press the lemons farther before drinking, the sourness from the lemon slices and the sweetness from the honey comes to a nice balance.<br&gt;<br&gt;As a few others pointed out, if price is an issue, do go to Golden Shoe for better priced drinks and food. But the service here plus the convenience and pretty good speed of fulfilling their orders would keep the crowds coming.<br&gt;<br&gt;As a side note, they do have a main competitor Teahut which also makes excellent honey lemon, but they tend to be a little generous with their honey and lemons."

Crispy on the top and bottom. <br&gt;<br&gt;The wrap had generous portion of meat. I liked the way they toasted the wrap which made some parts crispy. They also sliced it in two so it is much easier to share or hold. The meat was juicy too which made some parts of the wrap to be tender.

It makes for a nice neighborhood bakery cafe, but not worth traveling halfway across Singapore for it, like I did.

After the laser tag game we were exhausted, sweaty and couldn&amp;#39;t wait to eat dinner!<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Caesar Salad<br&gt;All the food pretty much came at the same time which we were appreciated, since we were starving. The caesar salad was okay, but abit too much dressing. Veggies tasted fresh and the portion was good.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Cajun Chicken Pizza<br&gt;We had 2 pizzas and shared amongst 6 people, 3 guys, 3 girls. It was perfect!

Family Waffle $22.90+<br&gt;What makes Pick Me Up a healthier choice is their home-made yogurt gelato! The second we walked in, we took turns trying to pick what flavours we wanted, we were getting a waffle with 4 scoops of gelato!<br&gt;<br&gt;As it is SG50, they have an interesting variety of local flavours. We decided to try the butter pandan kaya.<br&gt;<br&gt;With Taro, Butter Pandan Kaya, Swiss Chocolate, Pistachio, we had our family waffle which was so pretty! There were generous with the toppings! I loved the fruitty pebbles and the waffle itself was crispy on the outside and fluffy like a moist cake on the inside.<br&gt;Perched on top of the family waffle is an caramelized almond bark. The Taro was our favourite as it was very creamy and didn&amp;#39;t taste too artificial. The Butter Pandan Kaya tasted like a sea salt kaya, it was so good! I hope they sell this flavour with their regular offerings! The Pistachio and Swiss Chocolate were good as well.<br&gt;<br&gt;I definitely forsee myself coming back to try more gelato flavours.<br&gt;<br&gt;They also sell savoury waffles and all day breakfast sets!"

Fettuccini, carrot and zucchini ribbons are tossed in a light garlic oil, creating a very light, naturally sweet and tasty dish. <br&gt;I did feel that I could have done with a tiny bit of acidity but apart from that, it was perfect. <br&gt;And in case you need more salt and some protein, there&amp;#39;s always the option to add smoked salmon for an additional $3.00.<br&gt;<br&gt;Allegory of Love - Chicken and Waffles ($16.00)<br&gt;What better combination that crispy fried chicken on top of a thick waffle! <br&gt;The chicken was nicely tender and nicely seasoned, with its saltiness and hint of spices complimenting the crispy buttery waffle and maple syrup perfectly. <br&gt;The waffle itself was perfectly made. Crispy on the outside, yet fluffy on the inside. The waffle&amp;#39;s slight sweetness from the batter mixed with the aroma and slight richness from the butter, together with crispy and well seasoned chicken was a recipe for euphoria. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall a very well balanced dish! <br&gt;<br&gt;And if you love teas than this is definitely THE PLACE for Teas. Fruit teas, black teas, flora teas, you name it hey have it. <br&gt;Best bit, of you&amp;#39;re in the mood, there&amp;#39;s always the dessert tea option. <br&gt;<br&gt;Captain Buntan ($12.00)<br&gt;Pomelo tea with Yuzu Ice Cream <br&gt;This was mind blowingly good. <br&gt;It was the perfect sweetness mixed with a tinge of acidity made this drink intoxicatingly refreshing, hitting all the right notes along the way. <br&gt;A must drink, especially on a hot hot day! <br&gt;<br&gt;And when you&amp;#39;ve filled your stomach, it&amp;#39;s fine to let you creativity take over. <br&gt;Simply head next door and paint away!! <br&gt;<br&gt;Art Jamming ($48.00, 1-for-1) <br&gt;Canvas, paints, brushes (which you can take home) and aprons are provided for your convenience. All you need to do is to bring your creative flair and paint away. By the way, each jamming session comes with a free drink too!! <br&gt;<br&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re looking for an activity that takes up at least the entire afternoon (we arrived at 1.30pm and left at 6.00pm) than this is the place to be!"

But very pricey - $20+ per pax for 3 mains even with the Entertainer 1 for 1 deal. Eek. I&amp;#39;ve had more satisfying meals for a tiny fraction of the price. If I had to pay $25++ this would be a 1-star review I think. Tea/desserts were all more than $10 too. <br&gt;<br&gt;The part that was decent/passable/made it a two-star was the food. I expected bland, tasteless food, like some cafes where the cooks are really not competent. But food here was actually average, or even quite tasty! I ordered the short ribs croque monsieur. The portion of short ribs was generous and gooey and fatty and yummy. The sweet potato fries were also crispy without being overfried or oily. Although it wasn&amp;#39;t a huge portion, we all agreed they were pretty good. My friends didn&amp;#39;t have any strong objections to their duck confit/salted egg yolk cappellini, but we were not especially wowed either. <br&gt;<br&gt;This is a lovely place to dawdle and chill. If you want to catch up with girlfriends or read a magazine slowly, you won&amp;#39;t feel rushed in this half-empty restaurant. It would be even better (maybe 3 stars) if they served iced water...it&amp;#39;s seriously not hard to serve tap water, especially when they have waiters milling about idly, and patrons are paying pretty well for their meals. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if cafes like this can survive for long in somewhere like P.S. with abundant options.

They also have a selection of cups and other accessories to compliment your purchase.<br&gt;<br&gt;The best part, of course, is the fact that customers can come in and try out any flavor of coffee, for free! The service is excellent and the staff are very knowledgeable on all the flavors. They prepare your coffee very well, to your tastes, as an expresso or with milk.<br&gt;<br&gt;They do not hard sell and let you enjoy the coffee for what it is rather than try and over impose on you.<br&gt;<br&gt;Really, a lovely place to come in after a day of shopping and grab a nice cup of joe or  pick up your very own machine"

Their other drinks, Water Chestnut, Bandung, and canned options are also pretty affordable and tasty. Gotta try their Desserts - they are really, really, really yummy!!

Indeed, this Halal Cafe located in the Jalan Besar has won fans for its cupcakes and other pastries. However, it is also cosy place that offers brunch items like egg benedicts and pancakes. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Signature Red Velvet Cake ($7.90/slice) is drizzled with salted caramel for that savoury balance. The cake is moist and tender but the efforts were rendered futile by the intense sweetness evident in both the cake and the cream cheese. These seemed to be the case for the cupcakes and jar cakes, which were a pity because they looked good and stirred my excitement initially.<br&gt;<br&gt;However, the Sea Salt Nutella Tart was an instant winner with a crisp shortcrust shell and rich creamy Nutella. The addition of salt magically brought the Nutella to an optimal sweetness. The Belgian Chocolate Tart comes close behind with a 50-60% chocolate cream blended with milk chocolate but the cacao taste did not shine brilliantly that day. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you love poached eggs, you will be extremely pleased to know that there is quite a number of dishes to choose from the brunch menu. From the Norwegian Salmon Bagels ($18) to the Classic Egg Florentines in Ciabatta ($13), each one comes with 2 poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce. The classic Morning Benedicts ($12) is still the reliable choice as nothing beats a well-buttered and toasted English muffin layered with chicken ham and turkey bacon. <br&gt;<br&gt;Packed with a crispy hash-brown, scrambled eggs and cheese in a tortilla skin, the hangover breakfast wrap ($12) might not be the most delicious cure but it is definitely a nourishing pack to fight the headache and perk you up for the rest of the day."

I generally come here for the roast meat selection as well as the Ban Mian stall as they carry a Gan Lao Mian which I pretty much like. I will probably take a picture and write a little more about it the next time I am there. Maybe the only little dislike is that the seating is a little tighter and being my size, I naturally felt a bit too squeezy. Hmmmm.... Time to lose weight...

He was very chatty and made us laugh quite easily, so I had this feeling that a good experience was coming up.<br&gt;<br&gt;After perusing the menu, we called Richard over. I had questions about the juices, and he was very honest (&amp;#34;Oh, the second one? That&amp;#39;s just a fancy name for apple juice!&amp;#34;) I ended up choosing the Ruddy and Ready, which is their take on the classic ABC juice.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the French toast upon the recommendation of Miguel, while he tried the special, which was an omelet with a local twist. I loved my French toast, as it was light, there was a generous side of maple syrup, and the portion was perfect for me. The berry compote really made the dish! Miguel&amp;#39;s special was a well-executed savoury dish; good to know they can add in local flavours competently.<br&gt;<br&gt;As it&amp;#39;s now 2015, I encourage everyone to stop by and check out what they&amp;#39;re doing here.

The French Toast served with maple syrup &amp;amp; berry compote was Wow! I like my French Toast a little soft, likely due to slow cooking. However, this French toast was doused with egg cinnamon and dark sugar mix. Who knew French toast could be mixed with anything other than butter. The berry compote is a nice touch, adding that sweetness that so many of us crave in the morning. I know I mentioned that Suprette had an amazing French toast, Rabbit Carrot Gun just may be a little better! <br&gt;<br&gt;The other dish worth a try is the omelette with sugar cured prawns and topped with sweet Malaysian Sambal. The owner, Richard, dared me to try this dish and said to me that if I didn&amp;#39;t like it, it would be on the house. Let&amp;#39;s just say, I didn&amp;#39;t get my money back. :D Kudos to Rabbit Carrot Gun for delivering a traditional western meal with an South East Asian twist! I&amp;#39;m dreaming of it already, as I write this review.<br&gt;<br&gt;My only knock on this restaurant was the flat white. It was just that, flat... There is some seriously some good competition nearby, ie Group Therapy Cafe etc, so I can&amp;#39;t blame them. <br&gt;<br&gt;In terms of ambience, who can beat an open space on the corner of the bustling street of East Coast Road. Best of all, this spot has a neighborhood feel to it, which brings me back to my days of living in Brooklyn, NY. I would argue that this one shop turned the fortunes of Joo Chiat / Katong into the next new hip neighborhood. This resto oozes what this neighborhood can become.<br&gt;<br&gt;In terms of service, maybe I was a little spoiled since we were served by the gregarious and welcoming owner, Richard. However, I&amp;#39;ve been here once before on a weekday morning and thought the staff was courteous and prompt.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, one of my favorite brunch places on the Red Dot, if not my favorite. I can&amp;#39;t speak on behalf of the other reviews, which were written eons ago, but this place has surely improved since those were written. Keep it up guys!"

When we arrived, we were greeted by Richard, the lovely owner. He was very chatty and made us laugh quite easily, so I had this feeling that a good experience was coming up.<br&gt;<br&gt;After perusing the menu, we called Richard over. I had questions about the juices, and he was very honest (&amp;#34;Oh, the second one? That&amp;#39;s just a fancy name for apple juice!&amp;#34;) I ended up choosing the Ruddy and Ready, which is their take on the classic ABC juice.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the French toast upon the recommendation of Miguel, while he tried the special, which was an omelet with a local twist. I loved my French toast, as it was light, there was a generous side of maple syrup, and the portion was perfect for me. The berry compote really made the dish! Miguel&amp;#39;s special was a well-executed savoury dish; good to know they can add in local flavours competently.<br&gt;<br&gt;As it&amp;#39;s now 2015, I encourage everyone to stop by and check out what they&amp;#39;re doing here. With Richard now managing the restaurant most of the time, the staff here is well trained and his presence just makes the place feel very neighbourhood-y and lovely.

This brunch spot is downright AMAZING! From the food to the ambience to service. All great. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Breakfast menu is top-notch. The French Toast served with maple syrup &amp;amp; berry compote was Wow! I like my French Toast a little soft, likely due to slow cooking. However, this French toast was doused with egg cinnamon and dark sugar mix. Who knew French toast could be mixed with anything other than butter. The berry compote is a nice touch, adding that sweetness that so many of us crave in the morning. I know I mentioned that Suprette had an amazing French toast, Rabbit Carrot Gun just may be a little better! <br&gt;<br&gt;The other dish worth a try is the omelette with sugar cured prawns and topped with sweet Malaysian Sambal. The owner, Richard, dared me to try this dish and said to me that if I didn&amp;#39;t like it, it would be on the house. Let&amp;#39;s just say, I didn&amp;#39;t get my money back. :D Kudos to Rabbit Carrot Gun for delivering a traditional western meal with an South East Asian twist! I&amp;#39;m dreaming of it already, as I write this review.<br&gt;<br&gt;My only knock on this restaurant was the flat white. It was just that, flat... There is some seriously some good competition nearby, ie Group Therapy Cafe etc, so I can&amp;#39;t blame them. <br&gt;<br&gt;In terms of ambience, who can beat an open space on the corner of the bustling street of East Coast Road. Best of all, this spot has a neighborhood feel to it, which brings me back to my days of living in Brooklyn, NY. I would argue that this one shop turned the fortunes of Joo Chiat / Katong into the next new hip neighborhood. This resto oozes what this neighborhood can become.<br&gt;<br&gt;In terms of service, maybe I was a little spoiled since we were served by the gregarious and welcoming owner, Richard. However, I&amp;#39;ve been here once before on a weekday morning and thought the staff was courteous and prompt.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, one of my favorite brunch places on the Red Dot, if not my favorite. I can&amp;#39;t speak on behalf of the other reviews, which were written eons ago, but this place has surely improved since those were written. Keep it up guys!"

Sadly, the experience was disappointing. <br&gt;<br&gt;Despite a half empty cafe, food was served almost 30 minutes after coffee and juice arrived. The chalkboard advertised pork pie was minuscule and burnt -- the bottom crust was blackened and my knife couldn&amp;#39;t cut through. The eggs Benedict was so-so, which didn&amp;#39;t make the wait worthwhile. <br&gt;<br&gt;When I sent back the pork pie, the wait staff didn&amp;#39;t seem surprised. As no one from the kitchen came to apologize, I decided not to accept a replacement and canceled the item. <br&gt;<br&gt;The disappointment spilled over to our general appetites and we decided not to finish the flat whites."

Korean style 3rd wave / specialty coffee, with the usual range of espresso and manual brewing methods. They also roast in the shop - which accounts for the burnt cookie smell that fills the place from time to time. But what drew me into the store was the huge, white EK43 lurking in the corner that signaled the potential for a good pourover. Peeking behind the counter, portafilters locked tight into the group head are always a good sign of a café that knows its shit. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ambience is bright and airy, despite the tight confines of the unit, and the staff are friendly and welcoming. <br&gt;<br&gt;So, coffee. It&amp;#39;s certainly a step up from the other coffee outlets in the building. They do a tasty cold brew (also done in store), and espresso beverages are well-pulled. <br&gt;<br&gt;But of course any self respecting coffeenista will want to know what their hand brew is like. They brew with a Clever at 88 deg C, for about 3 mins. Have tried their Ethiopian and Kenyan beans, and found their hand brew to be a bit over extracted - nonetheless, still tastier than the competition. <br&gt;<br&gt;Still, it&amp;#39;s early days and I reckon I&amp;#39;ll drop by often since its in my patch. Staff were open to my feedback on the grind size, so I&amp;#39;m looking forward to some variety in their pourover."

I opted for mee pok since this is my preferred type of noodles. The noodles came fluffy and sufficiently chewy, and not at all soggy. I really enjoyed the noodles a lot. The base contained vinegar and of course chili sauce, and the combination of the two (with probably some secret ingredients) gave rise to one of the most satisfying bowls of bak chor mee I have ever eaten.

The delightful Burgundy Escargots.', 'width': 180, 'height': 180, 'caption': 'The delightful Burgundy Escargots.'}]",Jason L.,en,"Well... Isn&amp;#39;t this a surprise?<br&gt;<br&gt;Firstly, let me explain why I decided to rate this place, and register the coffee shop as one entity instead of reviewing individual stalls. <br&gt;Salute coffee shop is probably the first coffee shop that takes reservations, despite the stall you&amp;#39;re choosing to eat at. (I apologize for the lack of a contact number as most sites I&amp;#39;ve searched do not provide a reservation number. I will assume that their contact number is 6276 6445, which is Stew Küche&amp;#39;s number as they seem to be the anchor tenant and overall running the &amp;#34;operations&amp;#34; of the coffee shop). <br&gt;<br&gt;Secondly, this place has to be experienced as a whole. Though made up of different stalls, the coffee shop is dressed with table cloth (although they&amp;#39;re the plastic checkered kind, but yes, tables are dressed), has a queue line and well.. You&amp;#39;re not just going to eat from one stall here. The variety available is incredible! <br&gt;<br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my review on all the stuff we ate. <br&gt;1) Burgundy Escargots, Immanuel French Kitchen.<br&gt;I had my doubts when I first collected this dish. Personally, I prefer my escargots in the shell as they tend to overcook when removed but this dish was done so perfectly well. The tomato fondue wasn&amp;#39;t over powering and the garlic butter on top added a nice pungent kick to the dish and balances out well with the tomato. Escargots were still soft and tender despite being baked  with the other ingredients. A very tasty dish that went perfectly on the bread they served it in. <br&gt;<br&gt;2) Sous Vide chicken breast served with Barley risotto and mushroom Fricassee, Immanuel French Kitchen <br&gt;This... I can&amp;#39;t find the words for this but.. This dish was the star of the night.  It has to be.. By far, one of the best chicken breast dishes I&amp;#39;ve ever had. <br&gt;The beauty of sous videing a dish is that it locks the moisture in, allowing the protein to retain its moisture, locking in the flavours it was mixed with and creating and absolutely, delightfully fragrant dish. <br&gt;This dish was no different. Chicken was beautifully sous vide. A quick sear to crisp up the outside while ensuring that the meat remain most and tender. Served with an amazing Barley Risotto and topped with a mushroom Fricassee to give it and earthy wholesomeness to the dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;3) Prawns in Garlic cream sauce, Sea salt. <br&gt;When this dish first arrived, I thought it might be pretty average. Prawns didn&amp;#39;t look particularly bright and vibrant but one taste of the sauce, and my impression changed in a heartbeat. The prawns were perfectly cooked. Tender, juicy and cooked jjjjuuusssttt right. Garlic in the sauce wasn&amp;#39;t over powering and the sauce in general wasn&amp;#39;t too rich. The sweetness of the prawns were still prominent and sauce complimented the prawns perfectly.  <br&gt;<br&gt;4) Grilled Fish with Rice <br&gt;A simple dish done well. Rice was very tasty and the sauce complimented the dish perfectly. Not wish was that they gave more sauce! <br&gt;<br&gt;5) Laksa Linguine, Mian 面.<br&gt;There have been many variations of this dish out there as some of them were hits... More often than not.. Misses. This one though was an absolute hit!<br&gt;<br&gt;Linguine was al Dante. The seafood was cooked to perfection and most importantly... The sauce.. Was perfect! <br&gt;Fragrant and rich, the sauce tasted exactly what a laksa sauce should taste like. Most sauces tend to be diluted or lacking that punch but this laksa sauce had all the fragrances you might find in a bowl of laksa, but concentrates enough without being over powering. A wonderful rendition to an otherwise classic dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;6) Caesar Salad, Stew Küche. <br&gt;No this is a Caesar done well. More often than not, vasee salad&amp;#39;s are over dressed and not done properly but this Caesar was done the way a Caesar should be done. <br&gt;<br&gt;7) Mushroom soup, Stew Küche. <br&gt;A well made mushroom soup that&amp;#39;s not made of instant powder. Delicious and definately one to have if you love mushroom soups. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unfortunately, there was only 4 of us and we didn&amp;#39;t get to try to pork knuckles from Stew Küche and the wings from Two Wings, both which looked amazing and definitely a popular choice for diners. <br&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be back with more updates! <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, the &amp;#34;coffee shop&amp;#34; is definitely pricier than your average under the block coffee shops but with pricing for an entree ranging from $13-$20, it&amp;#39;s difficult finding such a wide variety of cuisines, with such amazing quality, at these prices!"

You have to check it out yourself for its &amp;#34;colony&amp;#34; concept that is just a lot of eye candy to take in, with plenty of gold-gilded merchandise for you to bring home.<br&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but gets nostalgic on the first drink that I&amp;#39;ve had here. Despite the number of tempting Signature drinks, it is down to some chilling drinks in this humid, non-airconditioned mall, and I ordered an Ice Blended Sea Salt Caramel, which taste perfectly icy and well blended with just the right amount of that cocoa powder, just a hint of salt, and a good balance of caramel sauce. How I indulge in it, and wish I have ordered the large cup! Till my next visit.<br&gt;And i did just order the large for my next visit, but oh boy, what could goes wrong, everything just went wrong with my drink. It is too watery, too much powder in it. Despite my request for being less sweet, it is sickeningly sweet. Forget about tasting that delightful sea salt, this is a cup of badly melted ice-cream, and now those heaps of hersey&amp;#39;s corn syrup caramel sauce made it so sickeningly sweet, it is just undrinkable. Ugh, crikey. <br&gt;Dont expect a new cup being made, this is Singapore, not the US, honey, suck it up and trash it into the can baby. <br&gt;For the love that that first cup brings me and its cute cafe design, i cant help but to justify that bad drink to me being greedy and ordered a large, that brings the proportion off, and still was drawn to it to order another cup, this time i stuck with regular. <br&gt;And guess what, thats the last straw (literally) i had with this place. How could a place that uses professional blending machine, and charge the rate of CBTL and Starbucks, be that different in consistency!! Even the worst of my CBTL drink is still much more drinkable than this cup. The blending isnt smooth, powder could still be tasted, proportion is way off. Drinking that gooey failed mixture is enough of a punishment when u lost your gamble. <br&gt;And their success rate is pretty low to me. Sorry, heading back to CBTL here."

Everytime we&amp;#39;re there, we always have a plate of either roast duck or roast meat rice and a big bowl of peppery bak kut teh to share.<br&gt;<br&gt;The roast meat rice is quite something on its own. I usually have the roast duck and roast meat mixed rice. The duck is not too fatty and the roast meat has that heavenly crispy skin. Mix that with a scoop of sambal chilli and you&amp;#39;re good to go. I think the rice is cooked with chicken stock, so it has that distinct chicken rice-esque flavour to it.

Being 2 pm, the office crowd has left and there were only a few stragglers left. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was told the bestsellers were the dry mee siam with assam chicken, assam laksa and ayam buah keluak set. I decided to get the dry mee siam with assam chicken though my inclination was for the ayam pongteh set. I guessed I liked to go with the recommended dishes when dining at a new place, especially when I was not sure what to order. <br&gt;<br&gt;I did not expect much as most dry mee siam I had was pretty lackluster. So I was surprised with their version. The dry mee siam packed a punch. The spices were subtly infused with the rice vermicelli and the sauce/gravy drizzled over it was full of the mee siam flavor - tangy from tamarind, lime and tau cheo (fermented beans). The only thing missing was the dried tau pok (dried bean curd) or tofu cubes. There was a small piece of shrimp and some slivers of fish cake, otherwise it was a plain dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;The assam chicken was equally good. There was a hint of smokiness in the chicken (still did not know why it would be smokey but it was all good) which was very tender and fell away from the bone easily with the fork. The gravy was not that assam-y (sour), instead it had lemongrass note to it. I think it would go better with rice than with the noodles. <br&gt;<br&gt;I would want to go back to try the other dishes. I find it rare to find places where you could actually taste the individual spices which made the dishes more aromatic and tasty. The last time I experienced that was actually in a nonya cafe in KL, Malaysia. <br&gt;<br&gt;The name of the cafe is a bit of a misnomer as the dishes are not solely peranakan. Some dishes are Penang style and the name Jonker is commonly known for Jonker Street in Malacca. Googling more, I found out the the owner&amp;#39;s grandmothers hailed from Malacca and Penang, hence the type of food served."
