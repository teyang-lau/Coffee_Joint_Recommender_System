This particular location had its Grand Opening this past weekend in the 313@Somerset Singapore Shopping Mall. Their menu includes Teas, Mochi, Cakes, and Ice Jelly with flavors that will blow your mind! I ordered their &amp;#34;Exclusive&amp;#34; Super Fruit Tea which consists of Guava, Dragon Fruit, Strawberry, Lemon, and Lime. Great flavors, just make sure you ask for &amp;#34;Less Ice&amp;#34; to get more tea than ice. They are still working out their kinks at this location (took 2x to make my drink, confusing checkout &amp;amp; pick-up for drink purchase) but by the time you get to try Nam Dae Mun, they will fully deliver!"

Even reliable chain 12 cupcakes was closed.<br&gt;<br&gt;Having been  desperate for a birthday dessert, we ended up at Nam Dae Mun since ... it was the only dessert place open on a Sunday afternoon. Judging by David C&amp;#39;s review of this place, it seemed like a safe bet. <br&gt;<br&gt;We got the Snow Jade Osmanthus cake in honor of Jade&amp;#39;s name :) as well as the Black Sesame Sticky rice cake. The osmanthus cake wasn&amp;#39;t fresh tasting and was in fact, a bit hard when we dug into it. Upon warming up in the microwave though, it was better. It has the texture of Filipino &amp;#34;puto&amp;#34; if you&amp;#39;ve had that before. I preferred the Black Sesame one and really liked the flavor of it.<br&gt;<br&gt;I also tried the signature HERME strawberry drink which came with fresh strawberries and brewed with premium high mountain tea leaves from Taiwan. It was refreshing and not too sweet since I asked for 50% sugar.<br&gt;<br&gt;Nam Dae Mun is a breath of fresh air since it offers something different in Singapore. It won&amp;#39;t replace the ubiquitous pearl drinks anytime soon, but it&amp;#39;s a welcome sight for sure."

The pasta by itself is not very tasty but if you put some bits of sun-dried tomato and garlic slices into it, each bite can be quite delightful. This came with 6 juicy plump prawns that went great with the pasta. <br&gt;<br&gt;Beef Burger - They asked for the level of &amp;#34;done-ness&amp;#34; and added they only do medium and up. So I clarified that medium rare is no no and waitress repeated &amp;#34;medium and up&amp;#34;. So we opted for medium and when the Burger arrived, we were surprised that the patty is very thick and when we cut into it, it was fairly pink. Strange for a &amp;#39;medium&amp;#39;. <br&gt;<br&gt;Smoked Salmon Pizza - Fairly generous with the salmon slices. The pizza was toped with a drizzle of avocado mayo. Interesting combo. My girl liked it enough. <br&gt;<br&gt;Pepperoni Pizza - This pizza was really covered with pepperoni slices! With such a generous coverage of meat, how not to be nice? <br&gt;<br&gt;Tiramisu - Quite a decent bowl of &amp;#34;yummy&amp;#34;!

Let me first say that this review is not a reflection of the entire cafe chain but this is specifically regarding the outlet located at Spottiswoode Park road. I believe that this is a new establishment with new staff and perhaps new chef? <br&gt;<br&gt;So the husband and I were around the area and we dropped in for lunch. We were craving for pastas so we ordered: Banana bread, Pollo (Penne pasta with chicken in avocado guacamole cream), Aglio Olio with prawns and 2 x coffee (iced latte and hot mocha). <br&gt;<br&gt;For starters they got our orders wrong, hot mocha became iced mocha, that&amp;#39;s fine but when they served the banana bread... man it tasted like cardboard. It was dry and crumbly. We have definitely tasted much better banana bread. <br&gt;<br&gt;Next came the pastas...The Pollo. What&amp;#39;s supposed to be a penne pasta dish, turned out to be spaghetti. Out of courtesy, the chef should first inform the customer that they have run out of penne and if it is ok to replace it with spaghetti? The guest should not have to ask the serving staff why is this spaghetti and not penne, only to find out the kitchen ran out of it. This is NOT proper restaurant etiquette. Not to mention, the pasta dish was bland and overly creamy. <br&gt;<br&gt;Next came my Aglio Olio... I was hopeful that this would be ok since it&amp;#39;s really the easiest to make. But no, this dish was a complete disaster! The pasta is NOT completely cooked through and the taste was really bland. After 2 spoonfuls of the pasta, and 5 prawns I could not eat any further. It really was awful. Honestly, I am not sure if the chef tasted the pasta before it left the kitchen. <br&gt;<br&gt;The bill came to a whopping 60-ish dollars to which in my husband&amp;#39;s own words was, &amp;#34;a complete waste of money&amp;#34;. Needless to say we will never visit this outlet again (the millennia outlet is ok though). Anyway, if you want to visit this outlet you eat at your own risk. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ps. I originally did not even want to give this cafe a 1 star rating, but had to do so in order to post this review."

I stopped in the first time to get a coffee while staying at a friends down the street. Service was fast and friendly and the coffee was delicious. It was a take away order so that was the extent of my experience. A few days later I stopped in to sit for breakfast and work on the computer. The server was immediately attentive, I received water, and my order was taken. Food came in a very short time. I ordered the poached eggs and avocado and a latte. The latter was exceptional and its then that I learned they source their own beans. As a coffee lover it was outstanding. My poached eggs were on a GIANT bed of mashed avocado&amp;#39;s and tomatoes and two really delicious pieces of freshly baked sourdough bread. I was pleased. If I were in America that would have been about $6 worth of delicious avocados! <br&gt;I sat near the kitchen and watched freshly baked goods come out of the oven for an hour. Everything smelled wonderful. <br&gt;<br&gt;I will definitely come back again, probably tomorrow. Pleasant vibe, good music, outdoor seating if you want, happy hour in the afternoon...<br&gt;<br&gt;Also, when people complain about price I feel its mostly their own fault. You can easily take a look at the menu and see what your in for, If you don&amp;#39;t like it, go elsewhere. There are just too many options. Its expensive to run a business. I had an amazing breakfast and a 4-shot latte for about US$15. I&amp;#39;m totally fine with that."

The decor needs to look like a cafe /bakery during the day and an evening hangout afterwards. Neither is achieved. I get a bakery out front, wine cooler but not fully stocked, craft beers, also not extensive, coffee grinder and espresso at the counter area. Most places that attempt so much fail miserably. Here we get a &amp;#39;high&amp;#39; pass. Their saving grace is their baked goods. The breads are very well done. And a lovely way to build goodwill with end of day complimentary eclairs. <br&gt;<br&gt;I will come back as the food is decent but price points are a tad higher than I would like.

It had that French feel to it. Quite spacious to start with. I ordered an omelette filled with mushrooms, roasted capsicums and mozzarella cheese, a raspberry chocolate lava cake and a latte. My colleague on the other hand ordered a goat cheese quiche.  <br&gt;<br&gt;I confess, I had given in to my sweet tooth and dug into my dessert first. The lava cake was just scrumptious! Wish I had ordered two of them. The raspberry-laced chocolate just oozed out of the cake wonderfully.<br&gt;<br&gt;My omelette though... I was confused if it was supposed to taste like that, or was there a self-service counter to get myself a salt or pepper shaker. Because if there was, I didn&amp;#39;t know. The omelette was so tasteless, that I had to make the most out of the capsicums for some flavour. The whole set was complimented with 2 slices of bread, which were hard. SO hard. For a french boulangerie, that was just unaccepted. Was it stale? I mean what kind of bread actually makes one bite and pull, and yet still refuses to let go? I was really unimpressed with my meal. Fortunately for my colleague, her simple quiche was good.<br&gt;<br&gt;With regards to the service though, you have to make your order at the counter itself. And if you ordered a meal like me, you have to bring the tray of food to your table by yourself. Hmm. Didn&amp;#39;t expect that when I stepped in. So many waiters around and yet still self-service?"

I don&amp;#39;t know how they do it and especially how they maintain consistency internationally, but these fluffy cakes of goodness are so flavorful and go so well with the blueberries and maple butter syrup that it&amp;#39;s just impossible to compete.

The pancakes were fluffy and the chocolate chips were a perfect complement. It was such a sweet, rich dish and I wish I had gotten a larger share (I split between 4 people though, so that shouldn&amp;#39;t have been a surprise). The eggs were delicious, and the biscuit that came with it was amazing - so buttery and satisfying. I would definitely recommend getting a few things to split, because then you can try multiple offerings. Next time I am in Singapore I will definitely come back!"

Its main outlet is in New York, United States. It is well known for its pancake and is known as &amp;#34;New York&amp;#39;s # 1 breakfast spot&amp;#34; by Lonely Planet, as well as, &amp;#34;Best Pancakes&amp;#34; by New York Magazine (twice). The place was decorated in a traditional, clean cut look.<br&gt;<br&gt;The usual menu was presented in a booklet.<br&gt;Besides the usual menu, there is daily special items on the board,<br&gt;as well as, dinner special items.<br&gt;<br&gt;Boozy Salted Caramel ($15++ left)<br&gt;vanilla ice cream, bourbon, salted caramel sauce<br&gt;Without alcohol ($10++ right)<br&gt;Pretty strong in the alcohol. The drink tasted very rich and creamy, but could not taste the salted caramel in it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Crab Cakes ($15++)<br&gt;Two crab cakes, served with classic remoulade, and house slaw.<br&gt;The crab cake was moist and creamy inside with chunks of crab meat in it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; Waffles ($21++)<br&gt;with honey-Tabasco sauce, a crispy Belgian vanilla buttermilk waffle, and signature warm maple butter.<br&gt;The chicken was served char burnt, which made one quite disappointed. Some parts of the batter was just too hard and bitter to be eaten. One had to remove the batter coating in order to eat. Although the staff saw that we had left much of the batter untouch when clearing the plates, no one asked us about the food. The waffle was not the usual crispy and fluffy type. Instead it was eggy and soft. More like kueh kueh type. Not bad with the maple butter sauce. But not really my type.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter ($18++)<br&gt;Served with wild blueberries.<br&gt;The first which I notice when the dish was served, was that the pancakes were super thick in size. The pancake was fluffy and soft, with a kind of eggy taste. Some may felt that the blueberries was a bit too sour. Nice but could not take in more a piece of pancake. It was way too much for me.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall felt that the food was overrated. Maybe I was expecting too much but it just did not blow me off. Although the place looked sparkling clean, I was surprised to see a certain small animal running through the dining area. No wonder the place had placed a notice that it would be closed early for maintenance on the coming Monday. I soon lost my appetite after that and trying to vomit everything out."

And Clinton Street Baking Co is now in SUNNY (hazy) SINGAPORE!<br&gt;<br&gt;They don&amp;#39;t take reservations, and we were here on a sunday morning, and the queue was 1.5 hours. By the time it was our turn to be seated it was 2 hours. Be warned that the queue is deceptively short because everyone just gives their handphone number and goes away while waiting. There are some red benches to sit on outside the shop but it could fit a maximum of 8 people. 2 yummy mummy-types tried to cut the queue (&amp;#34;why don&amp;#39;t we tell them that we have a baby?&amp;#34;).

A mush in a plate, it tasted as good as it looked. Which was not at all. I&amp;#39;d rather some mashed potatoes. Even the powdered ones that you get from 7-11.<br&gt;<br&gt;Other sides were good but not impressive. We had the southern chicken (skin was yums), the scrambled eggs with salmon (not baaaaad), and some farmer&amp;#39;s platter. Like, good but I wouldn&amp;#39;t wait more than 30 minutes for them.<br&gt;<br&gt;BUT THE STANDOUT WERE THE PANCAKES. 3 flavors - blueberry, banana, chocolate - to choose from. You can add 1 more flavour for $2. Same pancakes, different toppings. These were nice and fluffy and thick yet light. I think the only other place in Singapore that comes close so far is Skyve. If you put the pancakes from those 2 places together and made me choose 1, I don&amp;#39;t know which would win. But maybe Clinton Street because of that wonderful maple syrup/butter mix, which married the taste of maple syrup with the smoothness of melted butter.<br&gt;<br&gt;Come here!

They have a lot of the classics here; pancakes, eggs on toast, a big breakfast etc. I thought they might have more baked goods on offer in the display cabinet given the business name, but there were just a few scones and muffins. I opted for the smoked salmon scrambled eggs and was not disappointed."

They had muffins on display and I am partial to Western breakfasts. So I was sucked in. <br&gt;<br&gt;The first thing I saw from the menu was it was not going to be much less expensive. So maybe it&amp;#39;ll be great? Same for more?<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered what I thought was their signature omelette because it had their name on it. But it only comes with two add-in ingredients (besides the eggs, of course). And apparently nothing but those two plus the eggs because when the omelette arrived I was asked if I wanted salt, pepper, or catsup. The first sign of cooking mediocrity is the need to season it with any of those things after cooking, especially a $20 omelette. If I&amp;#39;d known I would have chosen bacon to go in there. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ugh. It was so bland. And dry. I regretted not asking for catsup. I regretted more not having salsa, which is the best cure for bland eggs.<br&gt;<br&gt;The hash browns, though, were remarkable. If it was a two-egg omelette instead of a three-egger I was pushing through I would have savored them more. <br&gt;<br&gt;My cappuccino was also well done. Final tally, $S33!<br&gt;<br&gt;At the hotel I could have bottomless juice, cappuccinos, an array of Japanese, Chinese, Indian, and Western breakfast items. Smoked salmon with capers. Fresh-made waffles. Croissants and danishes. Fresh fruit. <br&gt;<br&gt;I got less for more. I&amp;#39;m kind of amazed they didn&amp;#39;t have oatmeal (or porridge) on the menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;My punishment for not going to the kopitiam."

Its main outlet is in New York, United States. It is well known for its pancake and is known as &amp;#34;New York&amp;#39;s # 1 breakfast spot&amp;#34; by Lonely Planet, as well as, &amp;#34;Best Pancakes&amp;#34; by New York Magazine (twice). The place was decorated in a traditional, clean cut look.<br&gt;<br&gt;The usual menu was presented in a booklet.<br&gt;Besides the usual menu, there is daily special items on the board,<br&gt;as well as, dinner special items.<br&gt;<br&gt;Boozy Salted Caramel ($15++ left)<br&gt;vanilla ice cream, bourbon, salted caramel sauce<br&gt;Without alcohol ($10++ right)<br&gt;Pretty strong in the alcohol. The drink tasted very rich and creamy, but could not taste the salted caramel in it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Crab Cakes ($15++)<br&gt;Two crab cakes, served with classic remoulade, and house slaw.<br&gt;The crab cake was moist and creamy inside with chunks of crab meat in it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; Waffles ($21++)<br&gt;with honey-Tabasco sauce, a crispy Belgian vanilla buttermilk waffle, and signature warm maple butter.<br&gt;The chicken was served char burnt, which made one quite disappointed. Some parts of the batter was just too hard and bitter to be eaten. One had to remove the batter coating in order to eat. Although the staff saw that we had left much of the batter untouch when clearing the plates, no one asked us about the food. The waffle was not the usual crispy and fluffy type. Instead it was eggy and soft. More like kueh kueh type. Not bad with the maple butter sauce. But not really my type.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter ($18++)<br&gt;Served with wild blueberries.<br&gt;The first which I notice when the dish was served, was that the pancakes were super thick in size. The pancake was fluffy and soft, with a kind of eggy taste. Some may felt that the blueberries was a bit too sour. Nice but could not take in more a piece of pancake. It was way too much for me.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall felt that the food was overrated. Maybe I was expecting too much but it just did not blow me off. Although the place looked sparkling clean, I was surprised to see a certain small animal running through the dining area. No wonder the place had placed a notice that it would be closed early for maintenance on the coming Monday. I soon lost my appetite after that and trying to vomit everything out."

E.g., Lady M, Din Tai Fung, Tim Ho Wan, Lawrys, etc.) We came for lunch on a weekday, around 11:40, so there was no wait. My pancakes were fluffy and moist, and my friend&amp;#39;s country breakfast also looked delicious. My only complaint is with the service, which was rather slow.

The food is comparable and all. I&amp;#39;ll have to take their word for it. <br&gt;<br&gt;I only came here for some cake and I got the upside down pineapple cake. I don&amp;#39;t know why but seeing a badly sliced and sloppily presented cake annoyed me.

EAT the pancakes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Clinton St Baking Co. of Manhattan&amp;#39;s Lower East Side finally lands in Singapore with a huge splash, with glowing reviews in the island&amp;#39;s English language broadsheet, and features on TV.<br&gt;<br&gt;Stepping inside, the dining room successfully recreates that typical American diner feel, similar to the original in NY (but definitely much newer).<br&gt;<br&gt;The entrees were decently good, but I&amp;#39;d recommend the pancakes above everything else. Fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside, paired with a sinful maple-butter sauce that&amp;#39;s just amazing as it is calorific. Blueberry, banana walnut or chocolate chunk, they&amp;#39;re all good. The house brew is drip coffee, and refills are free!<br&gt;<br&gt;They had a couple of Southern offerings on the menu, but IMO they were Northern interpretations of Southern food. I liked that the buttermilk fried chicken had cornmeal in the batter, however the batter lost its crunchiness rather quickly and fell off the chicken before you had a chance to bite it. Conclusion, stick to the pancakes.<br&gt;<br&gt;They don&amp;#39;t take reservations, and weekend brunch lines are an hour wait or more. To avoid the crowds, I recommend coming in on a weekday, or late in the afternoon on a weekend, or heading for the pastry &amp;amp; coffee takeout counter instead.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a while since I was back in Manhattan, and I personally have not been to the original on Clinton St (there, I heard the lines are an hour long too), but comparing this to other brunch type places in Singapore they pretty much come out tops. 3 if this is a place in the US, 4 cos it&amp;#39;s in Singapore."

The Singapore shop matches the New York venue in some respects (main courses and drinks) and fails in other areas (pies and service).<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ll start with the good. For a shop known for its baked goods and pancakes, the drinks were fantastic.  The bourbon salted caramel milkshake was the best thing we had and the bloody mary, which is so rarely made well, was also delicious. The main courses we tried (pancakes and huevos rancheros) were every bit as good as the NY shop.<br&gt;<br&gt;Unfortunately, there were several areas where Clinton Street really struggled. First, the service was horrible. After we were seated, not one staff member came to our table without being asked. We had to ask for drinks, for menus, to order, to get a dessert menu, to get a check, and to have our check taken and processed. When there were quality issues with food (see below), we did not get an apology and the waiter seemed annoyed to have to deal with the issue.<br&gt;<br&gt;Second, when we arrived for brunch, two of the three pies of the day were unavailable. No explanation was give nor was any apology forthcoming. We tried the only special available (strawberry rhubarb pie) and the lime meringue pie. Both were disappointing. The crumble on the strawberry rhubarb pie was like a group of small, indestructible rocks. We could not break up the 10cm pieces with a fork -- and we tried! We were not provided a knife with dessert.  The lime meringue pie tasted good but there was so little lime custard except at the very edge of the pie that it tasted almost exclusively of meringue.<br&gt;<br&gt;When I pointed these out to our server he simply asked if we would like something different.

Like the smoke salmon sandwich, sometimes there&amp;#39;s only 3 or 4 pieces of salmon,  sometimes its salmon fiesta, sometimes there&amp;#39;s no sauce, sometimes there is. （）<br&gt;<br&gt;The crew is loud.

There&amp;#39;re also dodgy looking shops like massage and spa parlors, KTV lounges, money lenders, a &amp;#34;photon energy waves&amp;#34; &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; supply shop, a suspiciously darkly lit LAN gaming shop and plenty of empty units.<br&gt;<br&gt;However as we know, the only thing ambience guarantees you is high prices. Well okay the air conditioning here is quite anemic, but you don&amp;#39;t linger in this kind of place anyway.<br&gt;<br&gt;I took a walk around this shopping centre at lunch time and this was the most popular of the eating houses in the building so I decided to try it.<br&gt;<br&gt;There&amp;#39;re several stalls in this unit; so far I&amp;#39;ve patronised the economy rice and fried rice stalls.<br&gt;<br&gt;Economy rice:<br&gt;I got a plate of rice with 2 meat items and 2 vegetable items for $4.30, which is a price that&amp;#39;s hard to match in town. <br&gt;<br&gt;The &amp;#34;rendang&amp;#34; chicken was a generic curry sauce and didn&amp;#39;t look or taste like rendang (which is closer to a dry paste coating the meat). There was a bit too much chicken skin but happily not too much potato - many places put a lot of potato in their curries to cut costs.<br&gt;<br&gt;The curry pork was great, having a stronger spice blend and a thicker sauce which went well with pork, which is a somewhat heavier meat than chicken. Again there wasn&amp;#39;t much potato which was good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Large fried tofu cubes in a Thai-ish chili sauce was pretty tasty, though the tofu was a bit dry. Despite not being freshly fried it still retained some of its crunch, and the sauce was more complex than the usual &amp;#34;Thai&amp;#34; chili sauces which taste like they come from out of a bottle. The tofu cubes were also crinkly on the outside and firm on the inside (most places use a smoother type of tofu), and the texture was pleasing (most places do it very smooth).<br&gt;<br&gt;The Chinese spinach with ikan bilis was alright - not overcooked as some do it though I&amp;#39;ve had better.<br&gt;<br&gt;The curry sauce I opted to have spooned over my rice struck a good balance - it didn&amp;#39;t overpower the taste of the other dishes, while adding welcome flavour to the plain rice.<br&gt;<br&gt;This is definitely one of the better cai pngs (economy rice) I&amp;#39;ve had.<br&gt;<br&gt;Fried rice:<br&gt;It was okay.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ingredients wise it was quite generous, with small pieces of meat, crab stick, chinese sausage and even some small prawns generously scattered. There were even a few medium sized pieces of roast pork.<br&gt;<br&gt;Sadly there wasn&amp;#39;t enough wok hei (wok flavour) - maybe the fire isn&amp;#39;t big enough."

While they are technically a bubble tea shop, their strengths lie in their variations of jellies. While they do decent pearls, I&amp;#39;m not exactly a fan. <br&gt;<br&gt;I like that they have pretty interesting fruit flavours that are light and refreshing. I love their passionfruit tea and their mango green tea for the fresh fruits in them. The mango green tea is a current favourite although it is a little too sweet for me, even at 25% sugar level. It comes with agar-agar jelly, which has a nice crunch to it, as well as bits and pieces of fresh mango. Great for a hot day out on Orchard Road!"

Considering it&amp;#39;s been here over a year now, it must be doing pretty well. There&amp;#39;s always a line, especially now that Gong Cha upstairs is gone due to renovation works.<br&gt;<br&gt;Their speciality &amp;#34;A-Gan&amp;#34; black tea is quite good. like the pearls (although they always seem to run out of black pearls, and I am kind of freaked out by the white pearls) which are chewy. I&amp;#39;m somewhat of a bubble tea afficionado, so if I had to compare it to a bubble tea shop, I&amp;#39;d liken it to Gong Cha.<br&gt;<br&gt;The latest trend is the ability to dictate your sugar level, which A-Gan also offers. The 25% sugar level A Gan black tea tastes strongly of tea and is complemented with the right amount of sweetness to make it a pleasure to drink. This makes it one of my preferred bubble tea shops for black tea. <br&gt;<br&gt;The milk tea is quite decent as well, though at 25% , it is still a little too sweet for me.<br&gt;<br&gt;One MAJOR drawback though is that the staff are damn slow. Really . Really. Slow . How long does it take for one to make a standard black tea with pearl? I have waited five minutes with just one person (and one order) in front of me. Each time I&amp;#39;m faced with a not inconsiderable wait, so make sure you&amp;#39;re aware of this even when there isn&amp;#39;t a queue."

They serve all-day breakfast menu dishes such as all time favourite Eggs Benedict, among many other chef&amp;#39;s specials. It has an outdoor dining area that is sheltered as well as an indoor dining area complete with a bar top counter for beers and more.The interior is very pop culture like with chic and sleek furnishing. The dining area is mainly lit up by natural lighting from the glass windows surrounding the entire bisotro, so you can be sure to get really good photos during the day. The air conditioning was just alright and kept me cool throughout my dining session. The iced water they served was chilled and had a citrusy taste.The menu for the appetizers seems to have something for everyone, including my favourite truffle fries. Their all day menu looked very satisfying but there were interesting items on the main menu like seafood risotto and pan fried sea bass that I was tempted to try. The menu itself is very simple with reasonable prices. Check out the furnishing!<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Mela Merillo $4.20+<br&gt;This was an interesting drink or at least seemed like one on the menu. Listed as a mocktail tea that was strawberry flavoured. I was a bit shocked to see such a huge cup placed on my table by the waiter. Taste wise, it was more like strawberry syrup with peach syrup mixed with some sprite. The temperature of the drink was superb for the scorching hot weather outside.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Sea bass $16.80+ *Highly Recommended*<br&gt;Pan-fried sea bass in spicy tomato sauce with mash potatoes. I decided to pick this as my main as I felt that it would lighter but I was wrong. The sea bass was huge, in comparison to what is offered at most eateries. It had a very crispy fish skin and my knife exposed a very soft and tender fish meat that tasted both fresh and with the tomato sauce was mind blowing. But sadly, the tomato sauce does overwhelm the crispy fish skin a bit and so the fish didn&amp;#39;t stay crispy for too long. The mashed potatos were so soft and no clumps were seen. This was a perfect lunch option and I&amp;#39;m definitely getting it again. I cannot get over the crispy goodness of the fish and the sheer portion of the sea bass!<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Spaghetti Vongole $15.80+<br&gt;A crowd pleaser! Spaghetti &amp;amp; clams in white win sauce accompanied with a tomato salsa topping. We asked if we could get this without the tomato salsa but we were told it was cooked together with the spaghetti. This dish despite not having a spicy warning label was extremely spicy, like peppery mouth burning hot! They used a lot of garlic as well, so fellow office workers around, do check if you have external meetings after your lunch here before choosing this dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;4. Shibuya Toast $13.80+ *Highly Recommended*<br&gt;A cube of toasted, honey-drizzled, thick and uncut, soft milk bread, decorated with berries, topped with salted butter and vanilla ice cream. The thick toast had a slightly crisp exterior but the interior was kind of dry for my liking, but only on the edges. On the inside, the toast was layered with butter clustered all in the middle, evenly spreaded. The toast had a decent amount of sweet fragrance and when the staff placed it on my table. I could immediately sense my sweet tooth going &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;.Portion is strongly recommended for sharing between 2 or more pax. The toast was still decent. Really really love the texture of their vanilla ice cream, it was so smooth and light, with a melt-in-your-mouth texture. The ice cream was pretty frozen, so after a pro-longed photo taking session, the ice cream finally warmed up to the right temperature for my fork to ease it&amp;#39;s way into the ice cream. <br&gt;<br&gt;This shibuya toast is a great option for those with a sweet tooth! My only wish was that this toast should be served with a portion of honey or syrup that we could drizzle over the ice cream! There was some syrup all over the plate, but it just wasn&amp;#39;t enough for my &amp;#34;wannabe-diabetic&amp;#34; tastebud!<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall : Loved the ambiance at Bodacious, and their newly revamped menu. Just wished the staff could&amp;#39;ve been more attentive to our needs during a weekday lunch hour."

What you see is a large sign clearly visible on Orchard Road. It makes you think that is where this Starbucks is located. It is not. It is actually located down the stairs next to the sign. Plus, it is open-air. Meaning, you are not going into a Starbucks where you can expect air conditioned comfort. No, you will feel the warm air.<br&gt;<br&gt;The staff that work at this Starbucks are all very nice and they do their job very well. The actual design of this Starbucks is nice enough and they have seats and tables on either side of where the baristas are creating your drinks.<br&gt;<br&gt;This is certainly a great place to grab a drink or a snack on the go but if you want to step back from the elements this is probably not the best Starbucks to seek out."

But at $8.80 each, my bank account didn&amp;#39;t concur with my stomach.They don&amp;#39;t serve alot of cooked food, but they do serve some sandwiches and a waffle item.<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Chicken Mushroom Pie $5.50<br&gt;This was more of a snack sized pie, it&amp;#39;s really tiny and for $5.50, I didn&amp;#39;t see or taste any chicken or mushroom. Wasn&amp;#39;t impressed by this.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Seasonal Fruit Tart $8.80<br&gt;I loved the sweet fruits, the strawberries were huge, but to command an $8.80 price tag, it&amp;#39;s a bold move! The tart itself was crumbly and it wasn&amp;#39;t too sweet. They definitely can make good tarts, I did enjoy it! But will I come back here for this again? Probably not.<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Chocolate Tart $7<br&gt;Supposedly highly raved about, this was an interesting one, it was chocolate mousse on the inside but it wasn&amp;#39;t too dense/jerlat/heaty/&amp;#34;makes you feel like you&amp;#39;re going to get a sorethroat&amp;#34;. So I actually liked this one, as I normally stray away from chocolate tarts.<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, a good place to chill and if you like tarts and have a deeper wallet than your stomach can hold, go for it and try Drips! I know for a fact, I want to try alot more of their tart offerings but I just can&amp;#39;t bear to fork out $9 for another one!"

Clearly the spotlight would be on their desserts. <br&gt;<br&gt;I must admit to having been taken aback by the prices on display at the shop. Having just come from Tiong Bahru Bakery where I had a croissant for $2.50 (and what a croissant that was!), I was left quite confused when I found the price of a croissant at $4.50 here, and none of the cakes for anything less than $6, a little more than I felt prepared to. Nevertheless, I felt intrigued as to how a little cafe like this had planned to thrive in the Singapore&amp;#39;s increasingly saturated market with such high prices, so decided to give it a go.<br&gt;<br&gt;I asked the man by the dessert counter what he would recommend if I was only going to get one thing and one thing only, and he was quick to point out that their signature dish was the mixed fruit tart ($7.80), so I duly asked for one before he could say another word.<br&gt;<br&gt;On the walk to the back of the cafe to pick a table, I was captivated for a fair moments by a display of drip coffee by their coffee counter, a technique that I have found to be fairly trendy on my travels, but pretty rare in Singapore. <br&gt;<br&gt;Back to the tart, and I guess you could say it was as good as it could get - pretty much perfect in fact, but genuinely nothing that really blew my mind. The tart was topped with such a generous castle of raspberries and blueberries, crowned with the most luscious of cherries, which was true to its deep colour. The berries were surprisingly sweet, especially when raspberries can often get pretty sour. <br&gt;<br&gt;The tart was wonderfully made, not at all crumbly, but not rock hard either. This was filled in with a very consistent helping of custardy cream (or is it creamy custard?) that was not at all overly sweet. <br&gt;<br&gt;As I said, this was as good as it gets, and if you&amp;#39;re willing to fork out to find your perfect fruit tart, you probably don&amp;#39;t need to look no further. I just didn&amp;#39;t feel, and maybe will never feel, like I would need to pay so much for dessert in a no-frills cafe, and the simple man that I am would have been just as happy with the mixed fruit tart I&amp;#39;d find from the Delifrance around the corner from my house."

The cream custard was smooth and slightly eggy, goes perfectly with the plump sweet strawberries and blackberries. Perfect summer dessert alert!<br&gt;<br&gt;The chocolate tart is made from a high percentage of cocoa. Same pastry base as the Mixed Berries tart but this time with a rich dark solid filling.

Cute retro furniture and bright seats, and the seating area at the back even boasts a terrarium. Menu is pretty limited, and I went with a smoked ham sandwich and pear tart. The sandwich was generously filled with ham and vegetables, and slathered with whole grain mustard; my favorite. Strangely, it also came with two cucumber slivers and a small tomato. Not sure if this is a weak attempt towards fulfilling their customers&amp;#39; fibre intake of the day. Pear tart was ok, not bad. My colleagues found it way too sweet though, which I agree. I do like the firm tart shell and creamy filling though. Price wise, rather taxing on the wallet. Definitely not somewhere you could patronize on a weekly basis."

I settled for the blackberry almond tart and the cherry brandy tart instead. The blackberry almond tart was the better of the two. With a great balance of tanginess of fresh blackberries and sweet, accompanied with a slightly crisp yet crumbly crust, it was absolutely delightful. The cherry brandy tart was a little less exciting and I found it a little too sweet. <br&gt;<br&gt;The coffee there is not fantastic but is good enough to go along with their yummy tart!"

Clearly the spotlight would be on their desserts. <br&gt;<br&gt;I must admit to having been taken aback by the prices on display at the shop. Having just come from Tiong Bahru Bakery where I had a croissant for $2.50 (and what a croissant that was!), I was left quite confused when I found the price of a croissant at $4.50 here, and none of the cakes for anything less than $6, a little more than I felt prepared to. Nevertheless, I felt intrigued as to how a little cafe like this had planned to thrive in the Singapore&amp;#39;s increasingly saturated market with such high prices, so decided to give it a go.<br&gt;<br&gt;I asked the man by the dessert counter what he would recommend if I was only going to get one thing and one thing only, and he was quick to point out that their signature dish was the mixed fruit tart ($7.80), so I duly asked for one before he could say another word.<br&gt;<br&gt;On the walk to the back of the cafe to pick a table, I was captivated for a fair moments by a display of drip coffee by their coffee counter, a technique that I have found to be fairly trendy on my travels, but pretty rare in Singapore. <br&gt;<br&gt;Back to the tart, and I guess you could say it was as good as it could get - pretty much perfect in fact, but genuinely nothing that really blew my mind. The tart was topped with such a generous castle of raspberries and blueberries, crowned with the most luscious of cherries, which was true to its deep colour. The berries were surprisingly sweet, especially when raspberries can often get pretty sour. <br&gt;<br&gt;The tart was wonderfully made, not at all crumbly, but not rock hard either. This was filled in with a very consistent helping of custardy cream (or is it creamy custard?) that was not at all overly sweet. <br&gt;<br&gt;As I said, this was as good as it gets, and if you&amp;#39;re willing to fork out to find your perfect fruit tart, you probably don&amp;#39;t need to look no further. I just didn&amp;#39;t feel, and maybe will never feel, like I would need to pay so much for dessert in a no-frills cafe, and the simple man that I am would have been just as happy with the mixed fruit tart I&amp;#39;d find from the Delifrance around the corner from my house."

Luckily for us, Swirls Bake Shop opened up at the very trendy neighbourhood of Rodyk Street which is very near to Kith cafe and Toby&amp;#39;s Estate. Serving up cupcakes in various shapes, flavours, sizes and colors, Swirls Bake Shop was opened up by a charming couple who decided to start a business together. Very brave I must say. The lady boss came from a fashion background so the shop had design influences from that. They then embarked on a cupcake tour of USA to taste all the cupcakes for RESEARCH purposes. Isn&amp;#39;t that fun? They specialized in tasting red velvet cupcakes as well, which is coincidentally my favorite.<br&gt;<br&gt;I heard mixed reviews about Swirls. Some say good, some say bad. Timeout magazine said it was &amp;#34;possibly the best-tasting cupcakes we&amp;#39;ve ever had&amp;#34;.<br&gt;<br&gt;It is quite a small but cozy space that is divided into the kitchen and the shopfront. There are 4 chairs inside along a small counter, and more chairs outside.<br&gt;<br&gt;All the cupcakes sold do not have swirly icing which is ironic since the shop is called Swirls. We found that that is because the icing is &amp;#39;handswirled&amp;#39; with a flat knife instead of piped from a bag. That&amp;#39;s why every cupcake is unique.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well. The taste testing around all of the States did not go to waste. I tried the Red Velvet and found that it was really delicious! The cake was soft and fluffy, adequately moist and looked so good with the red coloring. It was not too sweet and all together just very enjoyable.<br&gt;<br&gt;For the rest of the cupcakes I found them rather average. The problem I have with cupcakes is that they tend to be very very sweet, so much so I will normally just scrape off most of the icing and eat the cake with a thin layer of it. <br&gt;<br&gt;It paled slightly in comparison to Plain Vanila Bakery&amp;#39;s cupcakes, but on its own it does pretty well."

Nestled in the Rodyk estate, it has garnered a strong following from the expatriate crowd and locals alike with their luscious cupcakes and wide variety of flavors (they have 101 thus far).<br&gt;<br&gt;This did not come easy. Former fashion stylist Alia S Dada and husband Danish road-tripped across the USA and Europe, stopping at every bakery they could find. The cupcake lovers tried and baked countless cupcakes before finally perfecting their recipe to bring us these moist and flavorful desserts. <br&gt;<br&gt;Strawberry Burst was a refreshing and tangy depart from the usual chocolate or vanilla cake. Fresh strawberries are blended into this one and topped with a strawberry cream cheese frosting. I like that it isn&amp;#39;t too sweet. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Red Velvet is extremely delightful. The interior is a moist and dense crimson chocolate and the light cream cheese frosting complements it well. <br&gt;<br&gt;My other favorite is What&amp;#39;s Up Doc?, a carrot-cake cupcake. This is something that i would get in the Colossal size (Giant Cupcake)! I would say it&amp;#39;s the best carrot cake i&amp;#39;ve tasted in Singapore. Shredded carrot is used in this cupcake and crushed pineapples were used to give it that extra zest. The cream cheese frosting is a tad too much for the tiny one though. <br&gt;<br&gt;Everyday, Swirls will showcase different flavours from their Specials Range, which changes every month. I simply have to rave about the Tiramisu. The coffee, kahlua and cream mascarpone is a lethal combination that blew me away. It&amp;#39;s my weakness. I would have a dozen of these anytime. <br&gt;<br&gt;Swirls Bake Shop is definitely my favorite cupcake bakery in Singapore! Highly recommended."

It has a sweet and savory tenderness to the meat and glistening soft skin that is enhanced by their homemade chili sauce made by blending chilies, lime juice, ginger, oil and other aromatic ingredients together. Served with rice that was cooked to perfection in the chicken broth making way for a fragrantly delicious rice. <br&gt;<br&gt;While visiting this food court, we couldn&amp;#39;t go without comparing this famed dish from two different rival stalls- -Tian Tian and Ah Tai (ex-veteran chef from Tian Tian). Therefore, in my true fashion, I did just that! <br&gt;<br&gt;Tian Tian, renowned for it&amp;#39;s Hainanese chicken rice has amass praises from the likes of Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay. The rice is the cornerstone of Tian Tian due to the richness of the broth that it&amp;#39;s cooked in and the gravy they drizzle on top to accentuate the dish. Served only with a side of chili sauce. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ah Tai, while lesser known, their chicken rice is equally if not better than its counterpart. You get the same flavor profile and texture from both stalls and the only thing that truly sets them apart is the fact that you get a bowl of chicken soup (perfect accompaniment for washing down your meal with) plus there&amp;#39;s hardly any queue. <br&gt;<br&gt;For something sweet post-meal we tried out the kaya toast and kopi from the 1950&amp;#39;s Coffee stall. The name and photos looked promising but, unfortunately it fell short. The toast as well as the coffee lacked flavors that I&amp;#39;ve grown accustomed to. The kaya jam tasted off while the coffee was bitter without the proper balance of the condensed milk to sweetened it up a bit. However, at the very least it fixed my sweets craving. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall you&amp;#39;ll be happy with either stalls and will leave wanting more!"

They were extremely slow and they were stingy with the rice that day.<br&gt;-Stall #62 &amp;#34;Rojak, Cockles and Popiah&amp;#34;: Got the popiah. It was made to order and it was delicious.<br&gt;-Stall #91 &amp;#34;Lao Ban Soya Beancurd&amp;#34;: Got the original beancurd. It was a nice refreshing tofu dessert.<br&gt;<br&gt;2/21/2018 early dinner (5pm):<br&gt;-Stall #7 &amp;#34;Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice&amp;#34;: Good chicken and rice. There could be a long line here too but the line goes by fairly quick.<br&gt;-Stall #78 &amp;#34;Muar Sugarcane&amp;#34;: Got the ice kachang and it was a nice refreshing shaved ice treat.<br&gt;<br&gt;I will be back again one day to try:<br&gt;-Stall #10&amp;amp;11 &amp;#34;Tian Tian Chicken &amp;amp; Rice&amp;#34; (Hopefully, they will be open when I visit!!!)<br&gt;-Stall #54 &amp;#34;Zhen Zhen Porridge&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;Take the MRT to Chinatown stop and it&amp;#39;s on the Downtown (BLUE) line. Then, you have walk about 5+ minutes to get here."

This is essentially a huge cafeteria containing 50+ stalls of food, drinks, snacks and everything you would want if you were starving, though that would be financially dangerous as you could buy a lot and still have another 50+ stalls to try. Although there are a good amount of stalls, there are probably 3-5 versions of the same stall, which one is better? that is dependent on the person although I&amp;#39;m sure most agree some are better than others.<br&gt;<br&gt;The more popular stalls stand out easily as people literally stand out in a really long line for that particular stall which makes you low-key want to try it because you&amp;#39;re just wondering &amp;#34;is it 30 people in line good?&amp;#34; and then you make your way into the 20+ minute line instead of a 1 min line that serves the same thing in hopes of 2% better taste but to each their own haha. <br&gt;<br&gt;All the stalls here have a great selection and I&amp;#39;m sure wonderfully tasty food (not that I would know since I haven&amp;#39;t tried them all). I had the hainanese chicken rice from two places, Tian Tian and Ah Tai, the two most popular chicken rice stalls. Although Tian Tian had the reputation and the lines, I found the more superior stall to be Ah Tai&amp;#39;s as his had more overall flavor and taste and just had better portions for the price compared to Tian Xian&amp;#39;s. <br&gt;<br&gt;There&amp;#39;s a good number of other stalls and hawker centers to try and I certainly will be back to compare which stalls fair the best!"

I had the roasted duck with  rice. There&amp;#39;s a nice sauce they add to the duck and the rice and man.. It was amazing. It was about $3 and was delicious, cant best that.

Arrived on a weekday after 12 and it wasn&amp;#39;t packed. There was a handful of open tables; I&amp;#39;m guessing people didn&amp;#39;t visit due to construction. <br&gt;<br&gt;So the saying goes if you don&amp;#39;t know what to eat, you have to try which ever stall has the longest line. Now here I was standing in line for their chicken and rice (with a side of vegetables because I have to get my veggies in), eagerly waiting and wondering if it&amp;#39;s worth the hype. To be quite frank, this was a good dish. The chicken was moist and had a good texture to it. I&amp;#39;m a little bit confused why they have (S/M/L) listed but the only size dishes offered is medium and large. Now it really depends on your preferences but I had better. For example, the chicken and rice at Siam Paragon Malls food court in Thailand is more flavorful. Their Rice is cooked with garlic and chicken stock soup creating a more flavorful mouthwatering dish. Overall I&amp;#39;m glad I can say I tried one of the most well known dishes while visiting Singapore."

That&amp;#39;s why both ang moh (tipped by tourist guide books or travel websites) come here. Prices are reasonable, not cutthroat as in tourist ghettos like Newton Circus. Of course, Singapore street food being so plentiful, many dishes are not represented, eg. fish head curry, prawn mee, biryani, claypot rice, sup tulang, etc. My favs are Tian Tian chicken rice, China Fritters, and Fuzhou oyster cake (see reviews)."

I followed the long lines this time and went for the porridge with chicken and century old egg from Zhen Zhen. Best porridge I have ever had in my entire life. Having tried some top places in Hong Kong and Cambodia, this place was hands down better than all. Waited in line about 50 minutes to order my food.<br&gt;<br&gt;Glad we had some regulars eat with us that lived in Singapore.  We all loved the Hainanese chicken rice. Tian Tian is incredible, you can even see Anthony Bourdain&amp;#39;s picture in the front of the place. :-)<br&gt;<br&gt;The only thing I didn&amp;#39;t like about this place was the heat! If it were enclosed they could put in some A/C but it is open on all sides and made it a bit uncomfortable.<br&gt;<br&gt;Glad to have found this place on Yelp, would have gone back Kovan Hougang Food Centre which I have frequented many times on my travels to Asia.

It had a good variety of stalls, without being too overwhelming. My first night, I tried hainanese chicken rice from Ah Tai. I really wanted to try Tian Tian&amp;#39;s, but they were closed. And there was a long line at Ah Tai, which is always a good sign. I read the articles about how the cook from Ah Tai used to cook for Tian Tian - chicken rice drama! The chicken rice set (rice, chicken, dipping sauce, soup, and veggies) was delicious! At another stall, I got the almond soya beancurd, which I guess is like a tofu pudding. That was good too! And another day, I came for lunch and had the hainanese curry rice: veggies, fried egg, pork cutlet, and curry over rice. It was also delicious and the old man working there was so nice. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s really fun looking around and getting food from the different stalls. There are always busy, but Saturday at lunch was crazy packed. Don&amp;#39;t be shy about sharing tables!"

Hawker food can be defined by its two main attributes: it&amp;#39;s cheap and it&amp;#39;s tasty. Don&amp;#39;t expect amazing creativity, fancy innovation or exotic ingredients. These uncles and aunties have been cooking the same five or six dishes for a while, so they have perfected them over the years. This degree of specialisation is not usually seen on restaurants. Cooks at hawker stalls won&amp;#39;t feel guilty about taking ingredients from tins, bags or boxes. They also won&amp;#39;t pretend to be cooking high cuisine. Hawker food is all about flavour.<br&gt;<br&gt;One of my favourite hawker centres is Maxwell Food Centre. Location is fantastic, right in front of the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, in that fuzzy border between Chinatown and the CBD. During peak hours it will be bursting with people wearing office attire and name tags hanging on their belts. It&amp;#39;s also a good spot to line your stomach before hitting Club Street, just a block away. There must be over one-hundred stalls, offering a massive variety of food for nearly all tastes. It&amp;#39;s pointless to try and describe the variety of food present. The only thing I miss is more Indian food, there are only like three stalls selling it.<br&gt;<br&gt;The dishes everyone should try are the sliced fish soup from stall 77 (their fried fish soup is also scrumptious), ban mian from stall 32, duck noodles from stall 71 ($3.50!), fried dumplings from stall 92 (the steamed dumplings look tempting too), and the almighty, delicious, always mouth-watering Fuzhou fried oyster cakes (at $2.00 each!) from stall 5. Absolute winner. All these stalls deserve individual reviews.<br&gt;<br&gt;Maxwell Food Centre also boasts the famous Tian Tian chicken rice. However, I&amp;#39;ve never tried it. Can&amp;#39;t be bothered to queue."

By local custom, we placed a tissue packet on a vacant table and went perusing the food stalls.<br&gt;<br&gt;With about one hundred different places serving a dizzying array of aromatic and appetizing fares, we were mystified by the choices and unable to decide what to eat. Bewildered, we just picked the longest line and waited in it. Before our eyes, the affable and impassioned chef sliced sizzling strips of pork, and heaped it atop a mountain of delicate noodles.<br&gt;<br&gt;Returning to our table, we found a group of ill-informed tourists in our &amp;#34;reserved&amp;#34; seats. Overlooking this serious breach of hawker center etiquette, we moved to another table, and dug into our seasoned pork noodles. <br&gt;<br&gt;As we savored our meals, an eloquent Singaporean gentleman with a shiny bald head approached us. He smiled broadly and said to my daughter that he had never before seen a woman hold chopsticks in her left hand. Now a 72-year-old retired professor, he went on to generously teach us about his country&amp;#39;s short but proud history and amalgamated culture.<br&gt;<br&gt;At the Maxwell Food Center there are a myriad of menu choices that epitomize the country&amp;#39;s world-class food culture. Our meals were immensely enjoyable, but it was our lucky encounter with a brilliant member of Singapore&amp;#39;s pioneer generation that proved to be a most enlightening way to celebrate Singapore&amp;#39;s 50th birthday."

I know that Singapore are well know for Hawker stand and that everyone get an options when it come to food. This hawker centre is located near Chinatown and offer three aisles of food. I feel like I was in food heaven for sure.  We opted for the black pepper crabs and mi goreng. As for drink, I got sugar cane and it was so refreshing. The crab was so yummy and filled all black pepper all over and the mi goreng was tasty as well. I added a little lime to the mi goreng for a sour kick to it which made a different to the taste and I like it. The services was top notch where they are friendly and helpful. This place is well maintain and clean. After the meal, we walked over to Chinatown and browse around. I high recommend this place if you are in the Chinatown and want good food.

The Maxwell Food Centre did just that for us.  We&amp;#39;d watched some online videos about this location and decided to try it once settled in.  We enjoyed our beer and milk tea drinks. The chicken/rice dish left something to be desired for my wife and a lot to be desired for me.  The rice was fine but the chicken itself was so gummy and borderline slimy, I worried I&amp;#39;d be sick later (thankfully I wasn&amp;#39;t). I guess I shouldn&amp;#39;t have been surprised considering 1) how long the line was for the food booth we went to, 2) how quick the line went. &amp;#34;Cooks&amp;#34; were just chopping what looked like chicken at super speed and slapping the result on top of rice in a bowl and shoving it at the waiting patron, NEXT!! With all that said, if you like that kind of chicken, you&amp;#39;ll be thrilled to have a yummy meal on the cheap.  If we are privileged to have a future return to Singapore, we&amp;#39;ll come to Maxwell again - one substandard experience at one food booth among -dozens- doesn&amp;#39;t not at all mean Maxwell Food Centre is not worthy of note.  As an example, before we left we wanted food for later so from a different booth we got breakfast sandwiches (because breakfast is delicious 24 hours a day).  When we did get around to eating them, we both wished we&amp;#39;d bought 4 instead of 2.  Oh yeah, last note - when at Maxwell Food Centre, if you see an open table, do a suplex off the top rope to grab it NOW.  Seating can be challenging when they are busy.  Or.....just plop down at someone else&amp;#39;s table with a little space and go for broke &amp;#34;howdy neighbor.....&amp;#34;"

I had no idea what is good here besides the famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice stall. It was closed on Sunday so the only long line on a Sunday evening was at Ah Tai Chicken Rice stall. I believe that stall is opened by an ex-employee of Tian Tian. I did not bother queuing for that and by 6.30-7pm, the stall has sold all its chickens for the day.<br&gt;<br&gt;Wandering around, I realized there are many chicken rice stalls in this place. In any case I tried the dry mee sua at a stall with a certificate stating its culinary achievement or something. It was similar to a fish ball noodle stall except it also included fried ikan bilis (anchovies). It was actually pretty good, and the small bowl of soup was tasty and not some watered down version of something passing off as soup. <br&gt;<br&gt;The satay was a bit tough. Rojak was good with crispy taupok (dried bean curd puff) and you tiao (fried dough stick cut into pieces). Fried carrot cake was decent though not with mouth melting soft kueh. The ham chin peng stall saw a steady stream of customers (but no line) and was actually smaller than other places. As it was hot, fresh out of the hot oil, it was very good. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unless you have a hankering for Tian Tian chicken rice or ham chin peng, I don&amp;#39;t find it worth a trip just to have something you can probably get at your neighborhood food center."

There are several reasons for that. First of all it is in a good location. Easy to reach and often not necessary to make a trip out of visiting. The second is that it offers a fairly clean and comfortable environment (compared to for example the Chinatown complex). Third good thing is that there is a great variety of good quality meals.<br&gt;<br&gt;What I am perhaps not as big a fan of is the crowds, come here at weekends or peak lunch hour the lines can be way too long for me.

The issue with the late lunch is that several popular places may then run out of food. <br&gt;<br&gt;What should you try here then? Well I will not pretend to be that much of an expert but in general the long lines are good bets. I have tried several different ones and the most I have been happy with. Tian Tian is perhaps the most famous one but I was not that impressed but I still think everyone should try it once to form their own opinion.<br&gt;<br&gt;I do love coming here for food and the atmosphere and every local as well as tourist should visit now and then."

I&amp;#39;ll write this one especially for foreign visitors, because I think some of you might not be aware of other options.<br&gt;<br&gt;Maxwell is good for offering a lot of foods that are now hard to find at normal food courts. For example, where can you find pisang goreng anywhere near the centre these days? A lot of hawker centres are using the same suppliers and offering the same taste, and a lot of food court chains (e.g. Kopitiam) are doing the same with an extra dollar or two for A/C and (sometimes) more premium ingredients. For preserving a lot of options that don&amp;#39;t exist elsewhere, and for offering some cheap options in an area that somewhat lacks them, I&amp;#39;m giving it 3*. Maybe I should give it 4 as the other big food centres like Lavender are all closing up and being turned into condos...<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s, however, very crowded, and quite expensive for what it is. And there ARE cheap, good options nearby. For example, I once walked into a random hawker on Keong Saik Road - Foong Kee Coffee Shop, according to Google Maps - and had well caramelised char siew, which is also hard to find these days amongst the soggy oversalted variety, for only a few percent above normal prices. And there was no queue. And the place was airy and comfortable. And you can also grab a beer for $5 (the same Tiger the hipster cafes and bars nearby sell for $15).<br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re hitting up Maxwell (or Lau Pa Sat) just for chicken rice, just look around Yelp or ask locals for recommendations in whichever area you&amp;#39;re in. Every neighbourhood has a hawker who makes decent chicken rice &amp;#34;properly&amp;#34; and it will be more &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; as well as tastier and a lot faster than queuing. If you&amp;#39;re looking for specific foods, they&amp;#39;re available elsewhere. If you want the atmosphere, go to level 6 at Plaza Singapura instead, where you&amp;#39;ll find an &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; A/C food court filled with actual Singaporeans filling up after their shopping (and yes, the queue at Riverside is totally worth it, and very fast). If you want &amp;#34;loads of choice, cheap, loud and authentic&amp;#34; go to Tekka Market&amp;#39;s hawkers (there&amp;#39;s even an espresso hawker)."

I finally made it to Singapore and what a treat! This place is the ultimate food court. It&amp;#39;s very easy to get to, you can take the MRT and get off at Chinatown. It&amp;#39;s about a 7 minute walk or less from the station. It&amp;#39;s divey and has no AC so wear something thin. This food courts consists of rows and rows of vendors, ranging from traditional Singaporean cuisine to fresh fruits and desserts. We tried tian tian chicken, Chinese donuts, beef chow fun and seafood fried rice (from Xiao Chao).<br&gt;All of the food was great but my absolute favorite was the tian tian chicken. I always wondered what all the fuss was about for plain chicken and rice but this dish is something else! The chicken was incredibly tender, almost like butter and it was served warm with cucumbers over white rice. The flavoring was a very mild garlic soy sauce which was lightly drizzled over the chicken and sank into the rice. It was heaven! My dad, who hates chicken, liked it! If you ever go to Maxwell, you must try this dish. The food was also dirt cheap. The tian tian chicken was $3.50 and most food there is $5 or less. The beef chow fun and seafood fried from Xiao Chao were also packed with flavor and unbelievably yummy ($4 to $5 each). I went early in the day so the heat wasn&amp;#39;t an issue but I recommend finding a table near the openings so you can catch the breeze while eating some delicious food."

If you&amp;#39;re a tourist in Singapore, you must visit a food court and taste the local food. Singapore is a melting pot of different cultures and cuisines and a Singapore food court is a very good representation of the variety in cultures there. <br&gt;<br&gt;For the ones who are not familiar with food courts, a food court is a place where you have multiple food stalls. You can buy your food from any of the food stalls, take your food from the food stall and have a seat at any of the tables and seats in the food court. After you&amp;#39;ve done eating, the staff will clean up after you. <br&gt;<br&gt;If it&amp;#39;s your first time visiting a Singapore food court, make sure that you bring a lot of tissues or napkins and wet wipes. You might want to wipe off the table or your hands or your mouth. And napkins are not provided in the food court. <br&gt;<br&gt;It can get very busy in this food court, so if you&amp;#39;re going to eat there, it&amp;#39;s better to bring a companion so that he or she can occupy a table or seats while you&amp;#39;re getting food. Otherwise, if you&amp;#39;re by yourself, it&amp;#39;s also okay to sit at a free seat at a table with other people and ask them to occupy a seat for you while you&amp;#39;re getting your food. <br&gt;<br&gt;My recommendations to try are the Haianese chicken with rice and a lemon kumquat fruit tea with a salted plum.

There is a big metal cauldron with an automatic stirrer that goes on and on so that the porridge is constantly kept in a well blended and smooth texture. Porridge options include sliced fish, fish belly, chicken, century egg. The porridge is the smoothest and creamiest I&amp;#39;ve had with hardly a trace of individual rice grains. The other star item is yusheng (raw fish salad), dressed with shaved lettuce, cilantro, ginger, sesame seed, sesame oil dressing, sliced fresh red chillies, and lime.<br&gt;<br&gt;We return to Maxwell on another day at 2pm for hainanese chicken rice and there is a line of customers at Tian Tian despite the off peak hour. We decide to do a little &amp;#34;chicken rice showdown&amp;#34; among ourselves between Tian Tian and Ah Tai. Just before this, we hear that Ah Tai, another chicken rice stall that is located next to Tian Tian, is operated by a previous chef of Tian Tian. There was a fallout which led him to open the stall next door, and even going so far as to having a signboard with the same blue color theme. We order half a chicken from each Tian Tian and Ah Tai. Tian Tian&amp;#39;s chicken is smooth and the skin retains the gelatinous layer which is very tempting to eat (admittedly, I decide to give in and sneak some chicken skin onto my spoon). It is what dreams are made of. The rice is fragrant and the glaze over the chicken has a good consistency. Ah Tai&amp;#39;s chicken pieces look more pressed and flattened. The texture is not the smooth as the chicken from Tian Tian. The glaze and rice from Ah Tai also fall short.<br&gt;<br&gt;The silky and milky broth at Jin Hua Sliced Fish Bee Hoon is what drives the line of people at this stall. The fish slices here are large with a solid texture. I do find it is misleading that despite the name of the stall having the word bee hoon in it, the noodles used look more like lai noodles (round, thick, and slippery noodles) rather than what I&amp;#39;ve come to know as bee hoon (thin rice noodles). The broth is silky and the added evaporated milk into the broth adds to the consistency. The flavor is evident but overall lacks an oomph factor."

We both ate it down QUICK.<br&gt;<br&gt;The rice is so garlicky but delicious. The chicken is boneless and almost skinless (I think we got lucky b/c we hate skin) but damn it was delicious with their chili sauce and soya sauce.

If you want an excellent selection of food to choose from and can handle heat and humidity (that&amp;#39;s just how Singapore is), then I highly recommend the Maxwell Food Center. It was a highlight of our trip to Singapore. It&amp;#39;s like going to the fair- there are rows and rows of places serving all types of food- Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Thai, Japanese, etc. And the drinks!!!! That was seriously a highlight- having FRESH soursop and sugarcane juices, and it was so cheap! I think it costs only about $1.25 or so each for fresh juice!!! Another favorite was the cockles my sister ordered. They were so sweet and tasty- oh so delicious! My brother who normally doesn&amp;#39;t care for them ate away with the rest of us. Just writing about Maxwell food court makes my mouth water...<br&gt;<br&gt;Oh, I need to mention one downside. First time we went was late lunch time so we had no issues. But the second time we went was right during dinner time. The problem was finding seating. This is like fast food. You order and are on your own to find seats. And this can be (and was) extremely challenging during peak meal times.<br&gt;<br&gt;But I would still definitely go back and brave the seating situation."

At the time that we were there, it wasn&amp;#39;t crowded, so we got our food pretty quickly.  The food court consists of a bunch of booths in several aisles.  Quite a few vendors were selling the food. We basically ordered from the pictures and they cook it for us right there.  Then we bring it back to our table and dig in!  First time I ate there, I had tom yum soup and shared a mango salad. The tom yum hit the spot and the mango salad was delicious!  The mango was raw enough that it wasn&amp;#39;t soggy and it was well seasoned with chili to add a spicy kick.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Since our meal was good AND cheap, we decided to come back for  dinner. This time, more stalls were opened, so we had more options.  We ordered ourselves some fruit drinks as well. We had sugar cane and soursop drinks.  They were so good!  The sugarcane drink was freshly squeezed. They squeeze the cane right in front of us. The soursop drink was something that we haven&amp;#39;t had before.  To our delight, it was extremely refreshing in the humid weather.  It was a little sour and sweet, with some meat in it.  We liked it so much that we ordered another 2.  <br&gt;<br&gt;I decided to walk around some more to check out the other stalls, and stopped at one that sells cockles.  That took me back to my trip to Thailand.  I ordered a large order and the guy cooked it right there for us.  I will have to say that was, by far, the best cockle I&amp;#39;ve ever had. They were so fresh, juicy, and sweet.  We didn&amp;#39;t have to season it with anything. The large order was devoured in no time by the four of us.  Needless to say, we came back here again.<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, I really enjoyed eating here. This was one of the highlights of our short visit to Singapore. I highly recommend that you eat here.  Just be sure to come at their off hours because it gets VERY crowded that it&amp;#39;s hard to find seats during their rush hours.  Enjoy!"

In the current environment that we are in, it is less often that we will come across such down to earth design of the cakes.<br&gt;<br&gt;With many bakeries keeping up with the modern equipment and modern look in their shop, this facade of the Balmoral bakery remains humble with red bricks by the side of the walls. Walking into the shop is like a walking back into the past with the time machine.<br&gt;<br&gt;Made up of Multi layers crispy &amp;#34;biscuits&amp;#34; with the top as chocolate and icing. In its buttery fragrance and the flaky thin layers, one tends to get addicted over it.<br&gt;<br&gt;The nostalgic feeling when you saw the blueberry puree topped the cake with a cream layer in between. To be frank, I was never a fan of blueberry cake when I was young as many of my birthday cakes were all covered with similar blueberries. However, it brought back a lot of good memories with cake having a old school taste!<br&gt;<br&gt;The traditional flavour that I love most is perhaps this Swiss roll that topped with peanut chunks and sugar. I always find this special somehow as compared to the usual Swiss Rolls cradling the creams.<br&gt;<br&gt;There are quite a few flavours of Swiss Roll to choose from like Pandan, Vanilla and Chocolate. These little Swiss Rolls were being shrink wrapped and placed in the chiller to maintain the moist. We had the most basic flavour of all.<br&gt;<br&gt;Besides selling cakes, they have pastries like Beef and chicken pie. I will be back again for other items."

They serve the traditional puffs and cakes that are now too rare or way too processed. Walking in, you will immediately realize that they have very different choices from most bakery and yet it smells wonderful. The aroma makes you want to get something. <br&gt;<br&gt;A few specialties I have tried there are their char siew song, chicken pie and curry chicken puff. Their char siew song is my favorite. They make everything, including their char siew in-house. It is very crispy on the outside and delicious barbecued char siew on the inside. The combination is just perfect. The curry chicken puff is also very tasty with spicy chicken, eggs and potato filling. Their prices are also very affordable at $1.20 - $1.80 a piece.<br&gt;<br&gt;It is always lovely to find a local place that keeps some of the traditional flavors. Definitely worth a visit!"

Everything is super old school- the kind of bakery that still pipes their cakes with sugary pastel-coloured creams and cartoon figurines, even in an era where fondant reigns. Strangely though, there is something very comforting about the mixture of butter cream and sponge cake and perhaps that is the reason why I keep coming back.<br&gt;<br&gt;It is possible to custom design your cakes. Everything looks kind of vintage and cool- I have seen cakes modeled after cars and having every bit of the &amp;#39;glossiness&amp;#39; through the boss&amp;#39; ingenious use of jelly icing, football poles on sports-themed cakes made out of chocolate wafers etc. Prices are also pretty reasonable for the kind of handiwork you get. To me the best part of the cakes is that they always look so home made, not the kind of rive gauche cakes that you wouldnt even bear to cut up."

For a light bite, the chicken quesadilla is pretty delish. <br&gt;<br&gt;I just saw the dinner menu and the rosemary lamb chop description looks tempting. So I guess I need to go back again for dinner some day."

I don&amp;#39;t think the place is perfect, but nothing really offended me.<br&gt;<br&gt;I came here for brunch on a Saturday with a friend. The online reservation was fully booked, but they said we could walk in. Walking in before 11am was OK. We were seated immediately. Soon after, the place really started to fill up. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had the bacon and cheese waffles, and my friend had the blueberry pancakes. The blueberry pancakes were extremely fluffy, and tasted just right. My bacon waffles tasted more of bacon and cheese than waffles. Definitely delicious. We ordered a cup of tea each, and that wasn&amp;#39;t memorable. They give you a teapot of hot water, which is good for about three teacups. The water kept warm for a long time, which was surprising.<br&gt;<br&gt;I thought the food was well done, although it would have been a better deal if it was a dollar or two cheaper. I used my DBS credit card and got 10% off so that was pretty sweet. This is the first brunch place I&amp;#39;ve been to in Singapore, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind coming back again.

This is all within like 10 minutes apart. when the savory snack arrived, I moved the cake to the side to eat the snack first. Halfway through it, I realized the cake was missing! We completely did not see the waitress clear it, but we only had 3 bites and it was such a waste to clear. We informed her it was a mistake and she said she assumed we didn&amp;#39;t want it since we put it to the side (Just ask next time!). She was apologetic and said she would get it back. <br&gt;<br&gt;You wouldn&amp;#39;t believe what she did next. She brought half a slice of the cake. A half slice! We were weirded out. I mean, what is she going to do with the other half? I thought that was completely cheap. We were like huh? And she told us it&amp;#39;s because we ate almost half of the cake (not true) but whatever, the cake was ok tasting but not worth this rubbish! <br&gt;<br&gt;If they can be so cheap, you won&amp;#39;t want to know what lame ingredients they may be using. <br&gt;<br&gt;So yeah, no smiles from all the staff after we complained it wasn&amp;#39;t cool to be cheap about the cake.

This was pretty good. Pizza come in thin crusts which made it crunchy. Even though the ingredients were rather normal, somehow the mixed ingredients added flavor to the two different types of pizza.<br&gt;4) popcorn chicken bites - came free as an option if you made a reservation through hungrygowhere. Came in smaller pieces but was pretty good after a few bites.

So to prove him wrong (I&amp;#39;m a fighter), I ate slowly to savour and also to not overkill myself in the start of the meal. The sandwich was rich in flavour and I can&amp;#39;t break it down to the individual tastes but it all came together very nicely. <br&gt;<br&gt;I opted for the set and they had cauliflower soup then. It was smooth and good and flavourful! Nice! <br&gt;<br&gt;The ambience was very chillaxing and a beautiful way to start the morning.

The bread was nice and soft with a slight sweetness to it. The pastrami was tender. There was nice onions in the sandwich too. But I wasn&amp;#39;t impressed, and in fact was rather frustrated at why I was still underwhelmed. After a whole day of thinking and discussing with fellow foodies, it finally dawned on me that (and this is kinda embarrassing for me to admit this) the sandwich was just not greasy enough! Maybe I&amp;#39;m used to something with more spice, something with more cheese, something with more warmth. Something this healthier version didn&amp;#39;t quite meet."

The menu is the perfect size, not too many dishes to choose from so that you&amp;#39;re overwhelmed, but just enough to have some good variety. I went for lunch with my wife, and we split the poutine to start and then I had the poached salmon as a meal. Both dishes were tasty, though I wish the salmon had been a bit larger or maybe some more garnish. I didn&amp;#39;t feel as though I got enough food for the money. I will definitely go to this restaurant again to try out some other dishes, maybe it was just the salmon that wasn&amp;#39;t enough for me. <br&gt;<br&gt;I have one other suggestion, as a person who grew up on the Canadian border, poutine was regular in my childhood diet. Nearly every restaurant in the area where I grew up served it, so I am very familiar with the Quebec taste and cuisine. My suggestion is: use Cheese curd. I&amp;#39;m not sure what kind of cheese was being used, but it was not plentiful, there should have been more and larger pieces. Also, more gravy!<br&gt;<br&gt;This place has a lot going for it, a lot of potential. Just needs to make some minor adjustments to get me to move it up past 3 stars."

I have been by a few times during my visit to singapore and they always very politely answer all my dumb American questions like if they have pumpkin spice lattes or if my mobile app will work here. Starbucks has consistent drinks and merchandise, but the service is variable and I like that this store is consistently friendly.<br&gt;<br&gt;I take that part about the consistent drinks back. Starbucks in Asia have some interesting drinks unavailable in the US. I&amp;#39;ve had matcha tea with red bean in Indonesia and yogurt citrus drinks in Singapore. Apparently I can&amp;#39;t get PSLs anywhere but North America, but I can settle for caramel macchiatos, and regular lattes. I also like collecting the city Starbucks mugs and picked up some singapore espresso shot mugs here (I&amp;#39;ve never seen these little cups anywhere else). <br&gt;<br&gt;This store has a little seating area upstairs from the cashier. It&amp;#39;s cute and comfortable, but can get crowded in the early afternoon. I&amp;#39;m also soooooo happy that they finally got free wifi.

The pastrami sandwich is delicious - lightly toasted ciabatta, beef pastrami with sweet chili relish, rocket, and Emmental cheese. the sandwich was going for $14 and I could nitpick, I wished there was more meat in the sandwich. <br&gt;<br&gt;I also bought their seasonal cold brew - Generra and Wicked. Both equally delicious and addictive ($9 each). Generra is mocha infused with orange zest while Wicked is infused with mint. I know the coffee elitist will be rolling their eyes while reading about Generra and Wicked, but hey, why limit yourself to only filter coffee or the usuals. It&amp;#39;s OK to try a variety of coffee beverages right? <br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in City Hall area and looking for a quick takeaway and not wanting the hassle to go into the mall, check out Gather. It&amp;#39;s located at Raffles Hotel Arcade and directly opposite across the road from Brotzeit (at Raffles City). I recommend this place!"

They don&amp;#39;t use any kind of syrup at all in all kind of their chocolate mocha drinks (not like Starbucks). I can testify on that cos I saw the whole process when my barista was making my drink. Here you&amp;#39;ll be spoiled by choice for your chocolate options. You could pick any of these: Cadbury, Toblerone, van Houten, Milka, Lindt, Godiva. You could literally have different chocolate coffee mocha mix everyday.<br&gt;<br&gt;My old times favorite are definitely Hawaiian latte, cold brew and matcha latte. Even though there are 2 other coffee shops in the same building, YCC would get my vote by a lot. The barista here definitely knows what they are doing.

The light sponge, punctuated by layers of mousse is sandwiched between a shiny layer of rich dark chocolate ganache on top, and a crispy hazelnut base made of cornflake crumbs below. The flavor is well-balanced; though rich, the cake remains pleasantly light in terms of texture, which leaves one craving more down to the last bite. <br&gt;<br&gt;Due to the low human traffic here, they have many promotions worth capitalizing on: <br&gt;1. Tea set ($6): one slice of cake and tea/coffee. Top up 50 cents for a latte. <br&gt;2.

While I could do with a few more slices of old cucumber in the soup, the old cucumber pork rib soup is awesome and very tasty. Same goes for the watercress pork rib soup. They also give a pretty hearty amount of pork ribs, which is always a good thing.

The baristas were really friendly and made me feel welcome. The latte was pretty good, though I regret ordering this vanilla thing to try in substitute of fresh milk - it sounded interesting, but really overwhelmed the flavors of the coffee. Another gripe is that the iced coffee is pricey and small at $6.50 for a 12oz cup. Joe and Dough just one floor above has a more generous portion. Though I didn&amp;#39;t get to try it, Joe and the Juice also has sandwiches, juices, superfoods drinks that reminded me of New York. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be back because of the comfy loungey space, with cushions for the long wooden bench lining one wall of the cafe, and padded seats throughout!

They also provide delivery services for those working hard at their office desk job and want something healthy!<br&gt;<br&gt;Their prices are reasonable too, the wraps/salads are priced around $6-8 and their cold pressed juices are $5.50 each or at $5 for a top up with a wrap/salad.<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Thai Rib eye $9.90<br&gt;So once you know what you want to get, you have to choose between tortilla wraps (original, spinach or tomato &amp;amp; basil), then choose a protein, (beef, chicken, fish, turkey bacon, seafood or mushroom), then choose your condiments and lastly, choose a dressing from a wide variety of homemade sauces.<br&gt;<br&gt;I picked, tomato &amp;amp; basil, mushrooms, couscous, pasta salad, mango salsa along with the thai mayo which was recommended for my thai rib eye.<br&gt;<br&gt;It was a delightful combination. I enjoyed every bite. Filled with tasty goodness! I highly recommend trying the thai rib eye! Although I might want to ask for a hard boiled eye rather than a egg wrap.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Yogurt Parfait $4.20<br&gt;The staff highly recommended the nutella one and so I got it. It was filled with granola on the top, and then big round grapes in the center which took up most of the cup, and then a layer of thick nutella and the yogurt at the bottom. I personally feel that for $4.20, it&amp;#39;s priced a bit steep, but it is a yummy dessert to go with your salad!<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Absolute Beauty $5.50<br&gt;The main ingredients were watermelon, grape &amp;amp; lemon. Advertised to improve heart health, improve blood flow, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, reduce asthmatic event and prevent migraines. That&amp;#39;s one very promising bottle of juice. At least the from the content of the drink I can indeed tell that it is cold pressed, as the fibres are not separating themselves in the bottle.<br&gt;<br&gt;The staff were very friendly and helpful in recommending items to be added into our lunches. All in all, I love this place and the concept! Eating healthy doesn&amp;#39;t always have to be expensive!"

I was afraid if I tried for &amp;#39;over medium,&amp;#39; I might confuse the server &amp;amp; end up with something that may not even resemble an egg.<br&gt;<br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with the American breakfast, shall we? It looked like nothing anyone in America would ever order. Scrambled eggs, ok. But the hash browns were those tiny rectangles that come frozen in long packages. There was a grilled whole tomato, which most Americans do not eat for breakfast. There was a pile of mushrooms. Yeah, we don&amp;#39;t usually eat those either. (Tomatoes &amp;amp; mushrooms in an omelet, yeah. But not solo.) Then there were some anemic looking hot dogs, which I imagine were supposed to be sausages? Oh. And a couple pieces of toast that must have been left in the toaster for roughly 15 seconds, if that.<br&gt;<br&gt;My pancakes were three deep on the plate with real Canadian maple syrup. The pancakes were perfectly round, all the same size, and all had that same shade brown as the frozen ones you buy from the grocery store. And yes, that&amp;#39;s exactly what they were. I ate my eggs &amp;amp; about one and a half pancakes.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a smoker, there&amp;#39;s great outdoor seating. The seating inside is limited.<br&gt;<br&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see myself going back anytime soon."

The Ultimate $12.50<br&gt;Being that The Coffee Bean is halal, everything here is either chicken or turkey. I do like turkey bacon, contrary to most people. The chicken patty was tasty, flavourful and not oily. The 3 slices of &amp;#34;bread&amp;#34; which was more like khong guan biscuits, was crisp and went well with the butter and jam. All in all an okay breakfast set. I think it&amp;#39;s pretty worth the money since it comes with a drink and a bread/soup set.<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Hazelnut Latte<br&gt;I  was quite stunned when I saw how big this cup was. Probably 16oz? Nonetheless, it was midly warm, just the right temperature to drink this. It was sweet enough at the begining, but as I drank towards the bottom, I had to walk up to a counter to add more hot water. <br&gt;<br&gt;The bread was okay, I did like eating it with jam and butter, but the soup was too diluted.

How it&amp;#39;s evolved from a meat patty, melted cheese between a toasted sesame bun to a level that&amp;#39;s..... gourmet worthy. <br&gt;<br&gt;We love a good burger bar and was gutted when discovering that Mojo Burps, one of if not our favorite burger joint, had closed. <br&gt;<br&gt;Since than, we&amp;#39;ve given a few other places a shot without much satisfaction, UNTIL NOW!<br&gt;<br&gt;We decided to do a takeaway because we&amp;#39;ve seen just how saucy their burgers can get and decided we should do a takeaway to avoid messing ourselves in public. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Wife had the Prime Beef Burger with Foie Gras while I went with a more Non-traditional, smoked salmon burger. <br&gt;<br&gt;Prime Beef with Foie Gras ($24.95)<br&gt;OMG. <br&gt;First the basics. The bun was nicely toasted and thanks to the Foie Gras, the top bun was flavored with the Foie Gras oil, which soaked in every bit of flavour it had to offer. <br&gt;The patty was a spot on. An inch thick patty, well seasoned and perfectly cooked (we had ours medium rare). The patty had a great fat to meat ratio, ensuring that it didn&amp;#39;t taste dry or chewy. Consistency of the mince was good as well, avoiding any portion of clumpy meat or overly mushed mince. The results? An extremely juicy patty that constantly dropped juices down the side of our mouths. <br&gt;The Foie Gras was pretty generous, with 2 thick slices, which added richness to the burger. Though not the highest quality of Foie Gras, they were still pretty good. <br&gt;The cheese was perfectly melted while the relish used added a nice sour kick to the burger, helping to cut the richness of the burger. <br&gt;<br&gt;Smoke Salmon Burger ($12.50)<br&gt;I was expecting maybe 6 slices of salmon, max, with tons of avocado. <br&gt;Turns out, it was the complete opposite!<br&gt;The smoked salmon was folded into a one inch thick patty while the avocado was a thin layer between salmon and bun. It was a smoke salmon lovers delight! Only thing I wished was for more avocado and more sauce and you could barely taste it over the salmon. It did need that bit of sourness to help cut the powerful taste of the salmon. Also, it did feel a little strange either smoked salmon between a burger bun, might have been  more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; between a bagel but hey, It still tasted good but I have zero complains with the generosity. <br&gt;<br&gt;Every order also comes as a set, which comes with a drink, salad and awesome wedges with cheese sauce. <br&gt;<br&gt;Hands down for now, this is my favourite burger joint. It may not be the most price friendly restaurant but it&amp;#39;s definitely worth it."

And Gruyere cheese sounds unfamiliar.

For the meal, you can either get the wedges for the price listed on the menu or add-on for other side dishes. I decided to try truffle fries with the burger.<br&gt;<br&gt;For the home made ice lemon tea, it is highly recommended. But unfortunately they placed too much ice cubes inside the glass that lost its taste after 20 or so minutes. Could probably ask them for less ice. <br&gt;<br&gt;For the truffle fries, it was good if consumed before 10 minutes. Unfortunately I left them out in the air for long and they turned soggy even though the truffle fries were of thin cuts. <br&gt;<br&gt;For the beef patty, I ordered it medium rare as that is what I normally choose for burgers. Sadly it was not as juicy as other Yelpers had mentioned. The bacon was chewy to my liking and the buns were nicely baked. <br&gt;<br&gt;Store wise, it is not so spacious and could only contain maximum 15 customers. So to avoid the crowds, you might need to come earlier. Portion was reasonable and it did satisfy my hunger."

Haha! <br&gt;<br&gt;One side note, the salad was a little oily, which was strange. <br&gt;<br&gt;We sat outside, so thankfully it didn&amp;#39;t feel cramped. <br&gt;<br&gt;Will go back!!"

Came down and arrived at an almost empty shop ( the ramen stalls round the corner were flooding with people ). One guy came to show us a table, was chill when we wanted another. Was hard to understand his accent when we asked the bestseller. But the taste of the burgers swept us away. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ordered a steak burger and a puller pork burger. Steak burger had superb truffle infused mayonnaise and steak patty (well done) was moist and didn&amp;#39;t have the raw taste. Pulled pork reminded me of kong bah (black sauce braised pork).

The lettuce inside was boiled, goes well with the pork instead of conventional salad kinda raw lettuce.<br&gt;<br&gt;Love the crispy potato wedges. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall it was a very satisfying meal!(:"

I have a coupon for this place from pickatsg but I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be using it. #disappointed"

Even though TCBTL have outlets all over Singapore, and I have been to many, this has got to be my favourite. Owing to its location (and I say this from a selfish consumer POV)- I especially like this place because it is hardly ever bustling, except maybe on a weekend afternoon. If you prefer to spend an afternoon people watching- then you are better off at the Holland Village outlet.<br&gt; <br&gt;Even the food seems better at this outlet. Placebo or not, I like to think I get more salmon slices in my salad, more cherries in my blackforest (yum!) and it never hurts to always have cute baristas in sight. Even though I sometimes find the furniture a little too closely spaced, it is usually never so crowded that you will have to sit directly beside someone/be privy to someone&amp;#39;s gossip session. For those who are looking to do some work/reading, be mindful that the lighting within the restaurant is not that good (don&amp;#39;t bother unless you are working on a laptop), but there is an outdoor space that receives plenty of sunlight though it might get quite warm in the middle of the day.

Not referring to every staff but the two frontline ice cream servers cum...erm &amp;#34;taste-testers&amp;#34; who were quite dutifully taste-testing the flavours yet  displayed an air of cold nonchalance towards customers. At least, put on a smile, yeah?"

Not this time!<br&gt;<br&gt;We discovered Creamier&amp;#39;s sinful creations one night when we had dessert at a new food bar on Ann Siang Hill called Lola which serves Creamier instead of the usual fare.

You&amp;#39;ll find none of that here. Just honestly good ice cream and reasonable UnSingaporean prices.<br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered a waffle with ice cream, but the price was only $7.50 and this being Singapore, I was concerned that we&amp;#39;d only be getting a tiny portion so I asked for an extra scoop of ice cream to go along with it. Little did I know that the waffle already came with two HUGE scoops and that the extra scoop would too much. Gotta love a place that feeds you well.<br&gt;<br&gt;Super sized portions are usually the domain of cheap eateries which attempt to make up for the lack of quality with more &amp;#39;value&amp;#39;. But at Creamier, you&amp;#39;ll find probably the BEST fresh ice cream in town, with some honestly good flavors. We tried the Richest Dark Chocolate Ferrero, Peanut Butter and Sea Salt Gula Melaka (local caramel-like palm sugar) and all exceeded our expectations. Everyone needs to try this place quick before it isn&amp;#39;t a secret any more..."

Icecream melted pretty fast though.. :/<br&gt;<br&gt;Funny thing was how easily the fork might just fell through the gaps on the wooden tables, making the experience slightly awkward, as I had to always make sure i rest it properly on a plank and not on a gap."

Artisan ice cream rocks especially if it&amp;#39;s at such affordable prices. A single scoop is only $2.90 for the standard and $4.90 for the premium. Each scoop is an intense burst of flavor and the servers are extremely generous with their ice cream. Suck that Udders, you and your stupid weighing machine. :P<br&gt;<br&gt;I was rejoicing at the gazillion black specks of the Tahitian Vanilla. Espresso is a must order for caffeine addicts like me. Earl Grey Lavender was a tad too sweet for my liking, could not taste much of the tea. Avocado was really smooth and creamy. Chocolate peppermint is like a liquid version of After Eights. Heavenly. No you don&amp;#39;t want to know how much ice cream i ate in 1 seating. <br&gt;<br&gt;The lava cake uses really dark chocolate, to the point it tastes almost alcoholic. It&amp;#39;s not that flowy but it&amp;#39;s not a bad snack. Pair it with a sweeter ice cream. <br&gt;<br&gt;Oh extra ice cream cups cost 50cents. Now that&amp;#39;s a funny story.. <br&gt;<br&gt;Love the ambiance of the sleepy mature estate. Glad that this is breathing some life into the place."

It&amp;#39;s a great place to chill with friends in the neighbourhood.<br&gt;<br&gt;The coffee is great. Thick, aromatic, everything you&amp;#39;d expect of traditional coffee. The Kopi Ping is done in the style of Ya Kun, ie whizzed in a blender to create frothiness. The eggs and toast are also very comparable to Ya Kun&amp;#39;s stuff. In particular, I would recommend the Iced Lemon Tea. It&amp;#39;s great on the hot day and they don&amp;#39;t skimp on the lemon. The tea is also not too thin and watered down, like the kind you unfortunately get at many coffeeshops.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service wise, the staff are also very efficient, if rather business like and hurried. Overall, I would really recommend this place for your regular breakfast/tea/kopi needs if you live in the vicinity."

Upon arriving with a sweat-soaked shirt and skin a shade darker, I asked myself: was it worth it? <br&gt;<br&gt;This cafe offers the standard fare: eggs Benedict, smoked salmon Benedict, sandwiches, pasta and the usual range of desserts. I ordered the crab pasta which was the most interesting choice on the menu, along with an additional serving of smoked salmon. It was pretty alright, though the crab was a little sparse and the sauce too garlicky for my liking. Next up was the beef baguette! Not bad at all, but with an extremely forgettable taste. <br&gt;<br&gt;To compensate for the strenuous walk, we ended with a chocolate lava cake and apple crumble! The latter had a superb crumbly top layer, which easily melts in your mouth! The apple filling was mild and not overly sweet, just the way I like it. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, to answer the question posed earlier: no, it was not worth the long and arduous journey from the mrt station. Sure, the food was good and the experience was certainly enjoyable, but I&amp;#39;m sure other cafes located within the heartlands can match up and even surpass the food found here."

While the meat paired with mashed potatoeswas nicely seasoned, it did not go well with the fruity sauce that resembled a familiar brand of jam. <br&gt;<br&gt;The ribs were served on a plate that was slightly too small for convenient consumption while the fries were a bit on the oily side.

The restaurant prides itself in using fresh (and some organic) ingredients and all of their meals are healthy and free of trans fat. I come here a lot for their sandwiches, salads, breakfasts and cakes. <br&gt;<br&gt;The best sandwich I think, is their veggie burger. Its really yummy and served with a beet chutney and a side salad. Their chocolate chip pancakes with cranberries are awesome. And the best part is that its served with REAL maple syrup, something hard to come by here in restaurants since its pretty expensive. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their cakes are pretty good in general. Some are not as good as the others. Stick to the carrot cake and the chocolate banana cake. Breads are pretty good too, although a little bit expensive. Cupcakes and cookies aren&amp;#39;t that great."

Agreed with some of the other reviews, although it was 930 there were a lot of stalls that were not yet open for business. The one that I was disappointed most for was the Tiong Bahru Hainanese chicken and rice place...oh well, next time! <br&gt;<br&gt;The famous lor me (a thick gravy with fat noodles, fish and egg) place was open though, and it was quite tasty (you can tell it&amp;#39;s the right one bc it will have a line). It seemed like a more traditional place, so was worried that we would have trouble ordering - but it was so easy! I really liked how it was &amp;#34;build your own&amp;#34;, meaning once you got the dish you could add as much garlic, spicy peppers, green onions and vinegar as you wanted! I highly recommend all the accompaniments, the garlic and vinegar together were delicious.<br&gt;<br&gt;We also tried the sugarcane juice (less sweet than I have tried at other tropical locations) and soyabean milk (slightly sweetened- was good!) at other stalls. <br&gt;<br&gt;There are honestly a million things to try, and I didn&amp;#39;t even recognize half of the dishes. I truly recommend this place, I think anyone can find at least one thing that they like and it&amp;#39;s a fun experience."

The center was big and there were lots of food options on the second floor (the lower floor is where you can buy groceries and other home goods). I loved how it was super clean! <br&gt;The chwee kueh and the fried carrot cake were by far my favorite! The chwee kueh is basically white kueh (semi sticky rice cake) with a generous layer of sauce that included some finely cut marinated veggies (冬菜), garlic, and other ingredients. It is a little bit oily but the sauce mixture is super flavorful. I tried the fried carrot cake because I&amp;#39;ve seen it on some YouTube videos. I got the black fried carrot cake and it was very delicious: the carrot cakes were lathered with some egg, onions, and a sweet soy sauce. I also got the classic kaya toast, sugarcane water, kopi, and fish noodles, all of which were great and had traditional flavors. There are lots of seating but can be busy on the weekends! The time I went, there were also singers who performed live. For someone who has been to Singapore multiple times, I think this hawker center really satisfies my local food cravings and would totally recommend this place!"

Agreed with some of the other reviews, although it was 930 there were a lot of stalls that were not yet open for business. The one that I was disappointed most for was the Tiong Bahru Hainanese chicken and rice place...oh well, next time! <br&gt;<br&gt;The famous lor me (a thick gravy with fat noodles, fish and egg) place was open though, and it was quite tasty (you can tell it&amp;#39;s the right one bc it will have a line). It seemed like a more traditional place, so was worried that we would have trouble ordering - but it was so easy! I really liked how it was &amp;#34;build your own&amp;#34;, meaning once you got the dish you could add as much garlic, spicy peppers, green onions and vinegar as you wanted! I highly recommend all the accompaniments, the garlic and vinegar together were delicious.<br&gt;<br&gt;We also tried the sugarcane juice (less sweet than I have tried at other tropical locations) and soyabean milk (slightly sweetened- was good!) at other stalls. <br&gt;<br&gt;There are honestly a million things to try, and I didn&amp;#39;t even recognize half of the dishes. I truly recommend this place, I think anyone can find at least one thing that they like and it&amp;#39;s a fun experience."

It&amp;#39;s quite obvious there as it is the only one, just walk towards the ban chang kueh stall deep inside the hawker centre<br&gt;<br&gt;- Ban chang kueh beside beef noodle. It&amp;#39;s really good and they are still doing it old-fashioned style which I personally prefer over Mr Bean&amp;#39;s<br&gt;<br&gt;- Nonya cake shop, located beside the kway chap stall. Near to beef noodle shop, try to spot the bright white neon sign. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Tiong Bahru Pau. You would spot this easily as they&amp;#39;re the only store to occupy two stalls at the left of the escalator. Queue early in the morning as they&amp;#39;re usually sold out by 11 am. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Prawn Noodle. It&amp;#39;s located somewhat near the toilet, you&amp;#39;d definitely spot it since it has a long queue<br&gt;<br&gt;- Oyster Omelette beside the famous pork rice. The stall is manned by a very nice and chatty uncle. Although I couldn&amp;#39;t really speak chinese, he still tries to relate to me, something I don&amp;#39;t really experience in Singapore anymore. The food itself is really good too! Large, fresh oyster was used and the sambal was very fragrant. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Char Kway Teow. This is the legendary stall, located to on the left when you come up from the escalator. Try to spot the orange store sign and long queue and voila you arrive at the correct stall. While it is very oily (by very I really do mean it), it has that wok hei that no food court has managed to replicate. It is truly a definitive mark of an experienced cook. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure there are many others stall that are just as good but I may not spot it yet. The above are just a snippet of my suggestion if you&amp;#39;re crunched for time yet want to experience Tiong Bahru Market."

My friends and I tucked into a serving of fishballs, crispy &amp;#34;tau ki&amp;#34; skin and some ngoh hiong, or teochew spring rolls. I was not too impressed with the fishballs, as the skin was rather saggy. Ditto with the ngoh hiong. I felt that Old Chang Kee could do better! The crispy skin, however, was a rarity - I wish I had ordered more! Dipped into lime chilli sauce, it is really a shiok and sinful pairing."

I&amp;#39;ve had better chicken rice than what I tried here- the chicken was quite dry, although the sauce was good. I also tried the chwee kueh (is that how you spell it?). It&amp;#39;s honestly hard for me to describe what it is. I know it&amp;#39;s made out of rice flour, and the texture is sort of gelatinous, and it&amp;#39;s topped with pickled veggies? Honestly, It&amp;#39;s completely different than anything I&amp;#39;ve ever tried before.
